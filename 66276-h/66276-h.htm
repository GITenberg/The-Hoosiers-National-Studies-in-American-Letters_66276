<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p>These pages represent an effort to give some
hint of the forces that have made for cultivation
in Indiana. While the immediate purpose
has been an examination of the State&#8217;s performance
in literature, it has seemed proper
to approach the subject with a slight review
of Indiana&#8217;s political and social history. Owing
to limitations of space, much is suggested merely
which it would be profitable to discuss at length.
It is hoped that such matters as racial influences,
folk-speech, etc., which are but lightly
touched here, may appeal to others who will
make them the subject of more searching inquiry.
Only names that have seemed most significant
are included; many creditable writers
are necessarily omitted.</p>

<p>I take pleasure in acknowledging my indebtedness
to Dr. Edward Eggleston, Miss Anna
Nicholas, and Mr. Merrill Moores for their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
courteous responses to many requests for information.
Miss May Louise Shipp gave me
access to papers relating to her kinswoman,
Mrs. Dumont, which I could not have seen
but for her kindness. Miss Eliza G. Browning,
the Public Librarian of Indianapolis, Mr. H. S.
Wedding, the Librarian of Wabash College,
and Mr. Charles R. Dudley, of the Denver
Library, were most generous and indulgent on
my behalf.</p>

<small>INDIANA AND HER PEOPLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> rise of Indiana as an enlightened
commonwealth has been accompanied by phenomena
of unusual interest and variety, and
whatever contributions the State may make to
the total of national achievement in any department
of endeavor are to be appraised in
the light of her history and development. The
origin of the beginners of the State, the influences
that wrought upon them, the embarrassments
that have attended the later generations
in their labors, become matters of moment in
any inquiry that is directed to their intellectual
history. It is not of so great importance that a
few individuals within a State shall, from time
to time, show talent or genius, as that the general
level of cultivation in the community shall
be continually raised. Where, as in Indiana, the
appearance of artistic talent follows naturally an
intellectual development that uplifts the whole,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
the condition presented is at once interesting
and admirable. Owing to a misapprehension
of the State&#8217;s social history, an exaggerated
importance has been given to the manifestations
of creative talent perceptible in Indiana,
the assumption being in many quarters that the
Hoosier Commonwealth is in some way set
apart from her neighbors by reason of the
uncouthness and ignorance of the inhabitants;
and the word &#8220;Hoosier&#8221; has perhaps been unfortunate
as applied to Indianians in that it has
sometimes been taken as a synonym for boorishness
and illiteracy. The Indiana husbandmen,
even in the pioneer period, differed little
or not at all from the settlers in other territorial
divisions of the West and Southwest; and
the early Indiana townfolk were the peers of
any of their fellows of the urban class in the
Ohio Valley.</p>

<p>The Indianians came primarily of American
stock, and they have been influenced much less
than the majority of their neighbors in other
states by the currents of alien migration that
have flowed around and beyond them. The
frontiersmen, who carried the rifle and the axe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
to make way for the plough, were brave, hardy,
and intelligent; and those who accompanied
them and became builders of cities and framers
and interpreters of law, were their kinsmen, and
possessed the natural qualities and the cultivation
that would have made them conspicuous
anywhere. The Indianians remained in a striking
degree the fixed population of the territory
that fell to them. They were sustained and
lifted by religion through all their formative
years, and when aroused to the importance of
education were quick to insure intelligence in
their posterity. The artistic impulse appeared
naturally in later generations. The value of the
literature produced in the State may be debatable,
but there is no just occasion for surprise
that attention to literary expression has been so
general.</p>

<p>Indiana has always lain near the currents of
national life, and her beginnings were joined
to the larger fortunes of the national destiny.
Three flags have been emblems of government
in her territory, and wars whose principal incidents
occurred far from the western wilderness
played an important part in her history. Early<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
in the eighteenth century the French settled
on the Wabash, which was an essential link in
the chain of communication between the settlements
of the St. Lawrence and Great Lakes
and those of the Lower Mississippi; and the
<i>coureurs des bois</i>, as they guided their frail
navies up and down the stream, or sang their
<i>chansons de voyage</i> as they lay in lonely camps,
gave the first color of romance to the Hoosier
country. The treaty signed at Paris, February
10, 1763, ended French dominion and brought
British rule. The American Revolution made
itself felt on the Wabash when, in 1779, George
Rogers Clark effected the capture of Fort Vincennes
from a British commander. The first
territorial governor of Indiana became the ninth
president of the United States after the rollicking
hard cider campaign of &#8220;Tippecanoe and
Tyler too&#8221;; and when, years afterward, Benjamin
Harrison, his grandson, was elected
twenty-third president, the bonds between State
and Nation were close and strong. Indiana
valiantly defended herself against the
Indians in the War of 1812; she sent five regiments
to the Mexican War, equipped 208,300<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
volunteers for the war of the rebellion, and
7300 for the war with Spain. Slavery was an
issue on Indiana soil long before the Northwest
Territory had been divided. At a convention
held at Vincennes in 1802, a year and a
half after the organization of Indiana Territory,
a memorial was sent to the National Congress
asking that the antislavery proviso in the ordinance
of 1787 be repealed, and slavery was
thereafter a potent influence in territorial politics
until the admission of Indiana, as a free
state, in 1816.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The victories of George Rogers Clark were
not only of great importance in determining
the future political relations of the Northwest
Territory, but they defined the character of the
population that should dominate in the region
he conquered. The Ohio was the highway that
led into the new world, and the first comers to
Indiana in the years immediately following the
Revolution were mainly drawn either directly
from Pennsylvania, the Carolinas, or Virginia, or
were of that fascinating band of hunters and
frontiersmen of similar origin, who had only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
a few years earlier begun the redemption of
Tennessee and Kentucky from savagery. Kentucky
was a temporary resting-place for many
who later drifted West and Northwest; and
their descendants, markedly of Scotch-Irish
origin, are still clearly defined in Indiana.
Philadelphia and Charleston were the two
ports to which these Presbyterian Irish came
in greatest numbers in the early years of
the eighteenth century. They at once left the
seaboard settlements and spread along the
Alleghanies, the Pennsylvanians moving southward
until they met their Carolina brethren,
when the united stream swept with fresh
strength boldly into the Ohio Valley. Emigration
from the north of Ireland &#8220;waxed and
waned,&#8221; says Dr. Eggleston,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> &#8220;as the great Irish
linen industry of the last century declined or
prospered.&#8221; Some of these people were steady
and thrifty; others were reckless and adventurous.
The frontier life afforded an outlet for
their wild spirits, and Indian wars and the hunting
of big game were their congenial employments.
The Germans, also derived from Pennsylvania<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
and the Carolinas, joined the westward stream;
the English, the Dutch, and the Swiss added to
it in varying degree, but the North-Irish element,
dating from the earliest settlement, was long
potent in politics, society, and religion, and became
a most important factor in Indiana history.</p>

<p>Northern Indiana was settled much more
slowly than the southern half of the State,
owing primarily to the fierce resistance of the
Miami Confederacy, which barred ingress by
way of the lakes, rivers, and portages, and
defeated successive armies that were sent
against it. When the way was opened, the
Middle States and New England slowly contributed
to the population. Many of these
immigrants paused first in the Western Reserve
of Ohio, and a smaller proportion in Michigan.
It is a question for the scientists whether the
differences still observable between the people
of the northern prairie region in Indiana and
those of the woodland areas&mdash;differences of
thrift, energy, and initiative<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>&mdash;are not due as
much to natural conditions as to racial influences;
and they may also have an explanation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
of the fact that Indiana&#8217;s literary activity has
been observed principally in the southern half
of the State, below a line drawn through Crawfordsville.
The seniority of the southern settlements
is not a wholly satisfactory solution, and
the difference in antecedents invites speculation.</p>

<p>It happened fortunately that the worst element
contributed to the population of Indiana
and Illinois in early years&mdash;known as &#8220;poor
whites&#8221;&mdash;was the least permanent. Dr.
Eggleston describes them as &#8220;a semi-nomadic
people, descendants of the colonial bond-servants,&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
who moved on in large numbers to
Missouri so early as 1845, and thence from the
famous Pike County scattered widely, appearing
finally in California, where Bret Harte took note
of them. Professor Fiske in his account of the
dispersion of these people<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> does not mention
Indiana as one of their outlets, and the State&#8217;s
proportion was unquestionably small. Romance
has not attached to them where they linger in
Southern Indiana, although they are of the same
strain as their kindred at the south who have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
so often delighted the readers of fiction. By way
of illustration it may be said that in the hills
of Brown County the traveller passes here and
there a rude wagon drawn by oxen. A dusty
native walks beside the team, and seated on the
floor of the wagon is an old grandmother,
smoking a clay pipe with great contentment.
The same picture may be met within the Kentucky
and Tennessee mountains, but with the
difference that in those regions the story-tellers
have woven the spell of romance about the hill
folk, whereas in Indiana similar characters are
looked upon as ugly and uninteresting.</p>

<p>The rural and urban classes produced a first
generation that realized a type drawing strength
from both farm and town and destined to steady
improvement throughout the century. New
people poured in from the Eastern States and
from Europe; but in no old community of the
seaboard has loftier dignity been conferred by
long residence or pioneer ancestry than in
Indiana. This pride was brought in more particularly
from the Southeast, and there are still
communities in which the stranger will be sensible
of it. The native Americans of Indiana have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
continued the dominant element to a greater
extent than in most Northern States, 74 per
cent of the total population in 1890 consisting
of natives; 20 per cent of natives of other
States; while the foreign-born population comprised
only 6 per cent of the total.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> In the
larger cities, as Indianapolis, Evansville, and
Fort Wayne, the Germans had an important
part from the beginning, and the Irish were
well distributed; but before the Scandinavians
and Slavs had begun to seek homes in America,
the land values in Indiana had so appreciated
that this class of immigrants could find no footing.
The centre of population in the United
States, which lay just east of Baltimore in the
first decade of the century, moved gradually
westward, until, in the last decade, it lay in
Indiana at a point sixty-five miles south of
Indianapolis.</p>

<p>The older Indiana towns enjoyed in their
beginnings all the benefits that may be bestowed
upon new communities by a people of good social
antecedents. Many of these towns have lost
their prestige, owing to changed political or commercial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
conditions; the departed glory of some
of them is only a tradition among the elders;
but the charm of many remains. Indiana, as
Territory and State, has had three political capitals,
Vincennes and Corydon having enjoyed
the distinction before Indianapolis finally attained
it. Vincennes, however, refused to fall
with her political dethronement, but built upon
her memories, and became &#8220;no mean city.&#8221; In
1847 the railway connecting Madison with
Indianapolis was completed. Madison was thus
made the gateway of the State, and one of the
most important shipping points on the Ohio, with
daily steam packet to Cincinnati and Louisville;
but this prosperity was only temporary, for east
and west lines of railway soon drew the traffic
away from the river. Madison retains its dignity
in spite of reverses, and is marked by an air
of quaint gravity. It may be called picturesque
without offence to the inhabitants, who rejoice
in its repose and natural beauty, and do not
complain because their wharves are not so busy
as they used to be. The social life there had a
distinction of its own, which has not vanished,
though the names identified with the town&#8217;s fame&mdash;Lanier,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
Hendricks, Bright, King, and Marshall&mdash;have
slowly disappeared, and few of the
old r&eacute;gime remain. The juxtaposition of Kentucky
was not without an influence in the years
of the town&#8217;s ascendancy, and there was no little
sympathy with Southern political ideas in the
ante-bellum days.</p>

<p>Brookville is another town which, like Madison,
sent forth many men to bring fame to other
communities. It lies in the White Water Valley,
amid one of the loveliest landscapes in all
Hoosierdom. The Wallaces, the Nobles, and
the Rays were identified with the place, and each
of these families gave a governor to the State.
Abram A. Hammond, still another governor,
lived there for a short time, as did James B.
Eads, the distinguished engineer, who was
a native of Lawrenceburg; and William M.
Chase, the artist, also a native Hoosier, is on
Brookville&#8217;s list of notables. John D. Howland
and his brother, Livingston, lived there before
their removal to Indianapolis, where the former
was one of the most cultivated men of his day,
and the latter a creditable judge, and a wit
much quoted by his contemporaries. Centerville<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
lives principally in its memories, having been
the home of the Mortons, and of others who
attained distinction. The removal of the seat of
Wayne County to Richmond dealt the town a
blow from which it has never recovered, though
it shares with its successful rival in the reputation
which the county enjoys for the cultivation
of its people. The family of Robert
Underwood Johnson was prominent in Wayne
County; and though the poet and editor was not
born there, he lived in the county from early
infancy until his graduation in 1871 from Earlham
College, whose seat is Richmond. His
cousin, Mrs. Alice Williams Brotherton, the
author of two volumes of verse, and a contributor
to the periodicals, lived as a young woman
at Cambridge, in the same county. Fort Wayne
has always stood a little apart from the capital
and the other towns lying nearer the Ohio. This
has been due to its geographical position and
direct railway connection with Chicago and the
seaboard cities. Socially and commercially it
has not been so intimately related to the capital
as most of the other Indiana towns; but
it was an important centre, with unmistakable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
metropolitan airs almost as soon as Indianapolis.
Fort Wayne&#8217;s list of distinguished citizens has
included Hugh McCulloch, a native of Maine,
who was Secretary of the Treasury under two
presidents, and Jesse Lynch Williams, of North
Carolina Quaker stock, who was prominently
identified with canal and railroad building in
Indiana. Mr. Williams was a leader in good
works throughout his long life. Mr. McCulloch
wrote &#8220;Men and Measures,&#8221; a volume of
memoirs, and his family has produced a poet.
A grandson and namesake of Mr. Williams is
the author of several volumes of fiction.</p>

<p>Lafayette is one of the most attractive of
Indiana cities, fortunate in its natural setting
and in the friendliness of its people to all
good endeavors. Purdue University, the state
school of technology, which is situated there,
is not diligent in the sciences to the neglect
of the arts. Roswell Smith (1829-1892), the
founder of the <i>Century Magazine</i>, practised
law for twenty years at Lafayette. Terre
Haute has been the home of distinguished
politicians rather than of famous literary folk;
but Richard W. Thompson, who became Secretary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
of the Navy in President Hayes&#8217;s cabinet,
was a writer of books; and Daniel W.
Voorhees, long a senator in Congress, was
the greatest forensic orator of his day in
the Ohio Valley. Voorhees had none of the
qualities essential in a great lawyer, but he
was most effective as a speaker before the
people. The code of 1852 contained a provision
giving to the defence the final plea to
the jury in criminal trials; but this was changed
in 1873 because it had become notorious that
Voorhees and others of similar persuasive powers
could almost invariably procure the acquittal
of persons charged with the gravest crimes
by appealing to the natural sympathies and
domestic attachments of the jurors. Voorhees
received from Berry Sulgrove the name of
the &#8220;tall sycamore of the Wabash.&#8221; His
appearance was commanding, and many of
the dangerous qualities that go to the making
of personal magnetism were combined in him.
Thomas H. Nelson, also of the Terre Haute
group, was worthy to be named with Thompson
and Voorhees as an orator, though never
so widely known as they. He was a native<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
of Kentucky, and an accomplished man of
the world, who filled acceptably several diplomatic
positions. Salem, in Washington County,
is another of the older towns that contained
in its earliest years families of marked cultivation.
John Hay, the author, diplomat,
and cabinet officer, and Newton Booth, governor
of California and senator in Congress
from that State, were born there. At least
one generation benefited by the instruction
of John I. Morrison, sometimes called &#8220;the
Hoosier Arnold,&#8221; who sent out from the Salem
Seminary in the third decade of the century
a group of men destined to take high place
in nearly every field that called for character
and intelligence. Hanover, the seat of Hanover
College, enjoyed a somewhat similar atmosphere,
and Noble Butler, who afterward
became, at Louisville, the teacher in literature
and elocution of Mary Anderson, the actress,
was one of the Hanover faculty.</p>

<p>Indianapolis was planned under the direction
of Christopher Harrison, a man of varied
talents, who buried himself in the wilderness
of Southern Indiana early in the century, followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
by the shadowy tradition that he had
been an unsuccessful suitor for the hand of
Miss Patterson, the famous Baltimore beauty
who married Jerome Bonaparte. Emerging
from his exile, he became a resident of Salem,
sought consolation in politics, and was elected
lieutenant-governor in 1816. Among those
who assisted in marking the lines of the new
city was Alexander Ralston, a Scotchman, who
had aided in a similar task at the national capital,
and who brought to his work a fancy for
diagonal avenues and broad streets pleasantly
suggestive of Washington. Ralston was said to
have been obscurely implicated in Burr&#8217;s conspiracy;
but he became a resident within the
boundaries he had drawn for the capital in
the woods, and died there, an exemplary citizen.
Indianapolis was named by Jeremiah
Sullivan, in the legislature of 1821, which
formally designated the site of the new capital.
The older towns on the Ohio and in
the White Water Valley contributed at once
to the population of the place, and the currents
of migration from the East and South
met there. Dr. Eggleston described the town<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
in his novel &#8220;Roxy&#8221; as it appeared in
1840:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The stumps stood in the streets; the mud was only
navigable to a man on a tall horse; the buildings were
ugly and unpainted, the people were raw immigrants
dressed in butternut jeans, and for the most part afflicted
either with the &#8216;agur&#8217; or the &#8216;yellow janders&#8217;; the taverns
were new wooden buildings with swinging signs that
creaked in the wind, their floors being well coated with a
yellow <i>adobe</i> from the boots of the guests. The alkaline
biscuits on the table were yellow like the floors; the fried
&#8216;middling&#8217; looked much the same; the general yellowness
had extended to the walls and the bed clothing, and, combined
with the butternut jeans and copperas-dyed linsey-woolsey
of the clothes, it gave the universe an air of having
the jaundice.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Old residents pronounce the description unfair;
but however crude the earlier years may have
been, the founders were faithful to the settlement,
and among those who were there before
1840 were the Fletcher, Morris, Merrill, Coe,
Ray, Blake, Sharpe, Yandes, and Holliday families,
which were to be associated with the best
that was thought and done in the community.
In 1839 Henry Ward Beecher became pastor of
the Second Presbyterian Church, and he was a
useful citizen through the nine years of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
residence. Good lecture courses were provided
so early as 1855, and Edward Everett,
Bayard Taylor, Dr. Holland, Theodore Parker,
Park Benjamin, and Ole Bull were cordially
welcomed. The Civil War disturbed the old
order, lifting into social and political prominence
men who had had no connection with the
original leaders. Unfriendly feeling between
the Eastern element and the Southerners had
already been manifested in political contests,
and the war greatly intensified it. &#8220;Copperhead&#8221;
was the term of most odious significance
known to the majority of Indianians
during the war, and it continued to be such
for many years afterward.</p>

<p>The club idea took hold in Indiana early,
and societies for the study of art, music, and
literature have by no means been limited to
the capital. The Indianapolis Literary Club,
formed in 1877, has illustrated perhaps better
than any other expression of the life of Indiana,
the quality of the men who have dominated
there in the last three decades. In a
State where not to be an author is to be distinguished,
the members have written and read<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
their essays in that spirit of true cultivation
which takes its aspirations and attainments as
a matter of course, and not too seriously. A
president and a vice-president of the United
States have been on the club&#8217;s rolls, as have
cabinet officers, senators in Congress and foreign
ministers; but literary and ethical questions,
oftener than political problems, have vexed its
discussions, and it has been more interested as a
society in Newman, Arnold, and Emerson, and
in the thwarting of the <i>Zeitgeist</i>, than in material
things. The women of Indiana have been
important contributors to all agencies that
tend toward ideal living, and at Indianapolis
they have exerted an intelligent and beneficent
influence in literature.</p>

<p>The first governors and law-givers were distinctly
not of the bucolic type; and it is an
interesting fact of Indiana history that in an
agricultural State, where the &#8220;farmer&#8217;s vote&#8221;
has been essential to the winning party, farmers
have rarely found their way to the governor&#8217;s
chair. James D. Williams, familiarly
known as &#8220;Blue Jeans,&#8221; who was elected over
Benjamin Harrison in 1876, was the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
farmer pure and simple to hold the office of governor;
and this was not until Indiana had been
sixty years a State, and had passed beyond the
period in which an appeal to &#8220;Jeffersonian simplicity&#8221;
would naturally have been most potent.
The second farmer to be elected governor was
Claude Matthews, who was a candidate in
the year of Mr. Cleveland&#8217;s second success,
and he was a college graduate and a man of
affairs, and not really of the farmer type.
When, in 1896, for the third time, the State
went to the country for a governor, James A.
Mount, a scientific farmer and reformer of
farm methods, was chosen. The name of
Posey County has long been used as a synonym
for any dark and forbidding land; but
the public services of Thomas Posey, the last
of Indiana&#8217;s territorial governors, for whom
the district was named, were of marked variety
and value, so that the name can hardly
be used as a term of opprobrium, particularly
of the county that harbored the New Harmony
settlement. After Indiana had gained
the dignity of statehood, and throughout her
earlier years, she continued fortunate in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
class of men to whom she gave her highest
honors. Jennings, the first governor, was
a native of New Jersey. He was a fair
scholar and wrote creditable English. The
Hendricks family came from Pennsylvania and
contributed two governors to the State, and a
vice-president to the nation; and the name
remains after a century locally significant of
character and attainment. David Wallace, the
father of General Lew Wallace, and Joseph
A. Wright, who was prominent in affairs in
the earlier half of the century, were natives
of Pennsylvania. Wallace had been educated
at West Point, but resigned from the army to
take up the law; he became noted as an orator
and was governor of the State. Wright,
who paid his way through Indiana University
by acting as janitor, became governor, sat in
the United States Senate, and was minister to
Prussia. Governor Whitcomb was a native of
Vermont, Governor Willard of New York, and
Morton, the foremost man of the Civil War
period in the State, was a native Indianian.</p>

<p>Isaac Blackford (1786-1859), for thirty-five
years a justice of the Supreme Court in Indiana,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
was a native of New Jersey and an alumnus
of Princeton. He was one of the ablest
judges the State has ever known, and his opinions
as they appear in the eight volumes of
reports which he published are models of lucid
and direct writing. The law has always been
served in Indiana by able men; and it is a
satisfaction to contemplate the bench and bar
of the earliest times, when the court was itinerant.
Under the first constitution the Circuit
Court bench consisted of a presiding judge,
who sat in all the courts of a circuit, and of
two associate justices, elected in each county,
who were usually not lawyers. They were
supposed to insure an element of common-sense
equity in the judiciary, and even had
power to overrule the presiding judge and
give the opinion of the court. But the lawyers
had little respect for the associate justices,
and if the presiding judge could not attend a
sitting of the court, they declined to submit
important cases, and sought diversion at the
expense of the associate justices by raising
profound questions of abstract law. An attorney
named Pitcher once used the phrase <i>de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
minimis non curat lex</i> before an associate justice
described by Robert Dale Owen as an
illiterate farmer, short of stature, lean of person,
and acrid of temper. The learned counsel
had expected to translate for the benefit
of the bench, but before he could speak, the justice
interrupted impatiently, &#8220;Come, Pitcher,
none of your Pottawattomie; give us plain
English.&#8221; The lawyer did not pause or look
at the court, but continued talking to the jury.
&#8220;The case,&#8221; said he, &#8220;turns chiefly on that
well-known legal axiom which I have already
had occasion to bring to your notice,&mdash;<i>de
minimis non curat lex</i>,&mdash;which, when reduced
to the capacity of this honorable court, means&mdash;observe,
gentlemen, means that the law
does not care for little, trifling things, and,&#8221;&mdash;turning
sharply around on the diminutive
figure of the justice,&mdash;&#8220;neither do I!&#8221;</p>

<p>The first court houses were usually frame or
log buildings of two rooms, one for the grand
jury and the other for the court. A pole
stretched across the room separated the members
of the bar from the populace. Spectators
travelled hundreds of miles to attend court and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
hear the lawyers &#8220;plead.&#8221; The young attorneys,
called &#8220;squires,&#8221; long clung to the queue
as a kind of badge of their profession, and
were prone to disport themselves before the
rustics in the court yards of strange towns.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Good humor prevailed on the circuit; the long
horseback journeys brought health and appetite,
and cheerful landlords welcomed the bar
at every county seat. Good horses, trained to
corduroy roads and swimming, were a necessary
part of the lawyer&#8217;s equipment; and
a little quiet horse-trading between court-sittings
was not considered undignified. The
itinerant courts contributed to the political
advantage of the attorneys, taking them constantly
before the people of a wide area.
Political ambition was usual, and the lawyers
frequently cherished the hope of sitting in the
State legislature, or of reaching the bench,
with a State office or the United States Senate
as their farthest goal.</p>

<p>The even balance maintained between the
two greater parties in Indiana through many
years gave a zest to all political contests.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
Whether the Hoosiers have expressed wise
preferences or not in the years in which their
vote has been of consequence in national struggles
may be questioned, but it is interesting to
remember that Indiana and New York gave
their electoral vote for the same candidate for
the presidency at every election between 1872
and 1896, and that their vote in all these years,
except in 1876, was with the winning side.
Political independence has been fostered to
good purpose; in recent years there have been
instances of praiseworthy courage in the protest
against party tyranny. In no other Western
State has the idea of the merit system been
propagated so vigorously as in Indiana. Lucius
B. Swift, of Indianapolis, and William Dudley
Foulke, of Richmond, were leaders in the
movement for civil service reform, and enlisted
under them from the beginning in a roll of
honor were Oliver T. Morton, Louis Howland,
Charles S. and Allen Lewis, of Indianapolis,
and Henry M. Williams, of Fort Wayne.
Indiana University and Franklin and Butler
Colleges also gave moral support. Mr. Swift
began, in 1889, the <i>Chronicle</i>, a small paper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
whose publication was not undertaken for
profit. For seven years, or until its object had
been attained, he made it a merciless assailant
of civil service abuses, local and national.
When the historian of civil service reform
comes to his task he will find that the <i>Chronicle</i>
has in many ways simplified his labors.</p>

<p>The successes of several Indiana authors
were a great stimulus to literary ambition in
Indiana; and the literary clubs were an additional
encouragement. Poetry seems to the
amateur much more easily achieved than prose,
and poets rose in every quarter of the State in
the years following the general recognition of
James Whitcomb Riley and Maurice Thompson.
There was a time in Indiana when it was
difficult to forecast who would next turn poet,
suggesting the Tractarian period in England,
of which Birrell writes that so prolific were the
pamphleteers at the high tide of the movement
that a tract might at any time be served upon
one suddenly, like a sheriff&#8217;s process. At Indianapolis
the end seemed to have been reached when
a retired banker, who had never been suspected,
began to inveigle friends into his office on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
pretence of business, but really to read them
his own verses. Charles Dennis, a local journalist,
declared that there had appeared in the
community a peculiar crooking of the right
elbow and a furtive sliding of the hand into the
left inside pocket, which was an unfailing preliminary
to the reading of a poem. Rhyming is,
however, the least harmful of amusements, and
so fastidious a poet as Gray expressed his belief
that even a bad verse is better than the best
observation ever made upon it.</p>

<p>and as the office of the discourager of genius
is an ungrateful one, it is doubtless well that
many should implore the gods, in the faith
that an occasional prayer will be answered.</p>

<small>THE RURAL TYPE AND THE DIALECT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> origin of the term &#8220;Hoosier&#8221; is not
known with certainty. It has been applied
to the inhabitants of Indiana for many years,
and, after &#8220;Yankee,&#8221; it is probably the sobriquet
most famous as applied to the people
of a particular division of the country. So
early as 1830, &#8220;Hoosier&#8221; must have had
an accepted meaning, within the State at
least, for John Finley printed in that year,
as a New Year&#8217;s address for the Indianapolis
<i>Journal</i>, a poem called &#8220;The Hoosier Nest,&#8221;
in which the word occurs several times. It
is a fair assumption that its meaning was
not obscure, or it would not have been used
in a poem intended for popular reading.
&#8220;Hoosier&#8221; seems to have found its first
literary employment in Finley&#8217;s poem. Sulgrove,
who was an authority in matters of
local history, was disposed to concede this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
point.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The poem is interesting for its glimpse
of Indiana rural life of the early period. Finley
was a Virginian who removed to Indiana
in 1823 and had been living in the State
seven years when he published his poem.
He was an accomplished and versatile gentleman,
and his verses, as collected in 1866,
show superior talents. One of his poems,
&#8220;Bachelor&#8217;s Hall,&#8221; has often been attributed
to Thomas Moore. The &#8220;Hoosier Nest&#8221; is
the home of a settler, which a traveller hailed
at nightfall. Receiving a summons to enter,
the stranger walked in,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Where half a dozen Hoosieroons</div>
<div class="verse">With mush-and-milk, tin cups and spoons.</div>
<div class="verse">White heads, bare feet and dirty faces</div>
<div class="verse">Seemed much inclined to keep their places.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>The stranger was invited to a meal of venison,
milk, and johnny-cake, and as he sat at the
humble board he made an inventory of the
cabin&#8217;s contents:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;One side was lined with divers garments,</div>
<div class="verse">The other spread with skins of varmints:</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
<div class="verse">Dried pumpkins overhead were strung,</div>
<div class="verse">Where venison hams in plenty hung;</div>
<div class="verse">Two rifles placed above the door;</div>
<div class="verse">Three dogs lay stretched upon the floor,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">In short, the domicile was rife</div>
<div class="verse">With specimens of Hoosier life.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Hoosieroons&#8221; is never heard now, and was
probably invented by Finley for the sake
of the rhyme. Both Governor Wright and
O. H. Smith were of the opinion that &#8220;Hoosier&#8221;
was a corruption of &#8220;Who&#8217;s here&#8221; (<i>yere</i> or
<i>hyer</i>) and Smith<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> has sought to dramatize
its history:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The night was dark, the rain falling in torrents, when
the inmates of a small log cabin in the woods of early
Indiana were aroused from their slumbers by a low knocking
at the only door of the cabin. The man of the house,
as he had been accustomed to do on like occasions, rose
from his bed and hallooed, &#8216;Who&#8217;s here?&#8217; The outsiders
answered, &#8216;Friends, out bird-catching. Can we stay till
morning?&#8217; The door was opened, and the strangers
entered. A good log fire soon gave light and warmth to
the room. Stranger to the host: &#8216;What did you say when
I knocked?&#8217; &#8216;I said, Who&#8217;s here?&#8217; &#8216;I thought you said
Hoosier.&#8217; The bird-catchers left after breakfast, but next
night returned and hallooed at the door, &#8216;Hoosier;&#8217; and
from that time the Indianians have been called Hoosiers.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>This is the explanation usually given to
inquirers within the State. The objection has
sometimes been raised to this story, that the
natural reply to a salutation in the wilderness
would be &#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; out of which
&#8220;Hoosier&#8221; could hardly be formed; but careful
observers of Western and Southern dialects
declare that &#8220;Who&#8217;s hyer?&#8221; was, and in
obscure localities remains, the common answer
to a midnight hail.</p>

<p>Sulgrove related the incident of an Irishman,
employed in excavating the canal around
the falls at Louisville, who declared after a
fight in which he had vanquished several
fellow-laborers that he was &#8220;a husher,&#8221; and
this was offered as a possible origin of the
word. The same writer suggested another explanation,
that a certain Colonel Lehmanowski,
a Polish officer who lectured through the West
on Napoleon&#8217;s wars, pronounced Hussar in a
way that captivated some roystering fellow, who
applied the word to himself in self-glorification,
pronouncing it &#8220;Hoosier.&#8221; Lehmanowski&#8217;s
identity has been established as a sojourner in
Indiana, and his son was a member of an Indiana<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
regiment in the Civil War. The Rev. Aaron
Woods<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> is another contributor to the literature of
the subject, giving the Lehmanowski story with
a few variations. When the young men of the
Indiana side of the Ohio crossed over to Louisville,
the Kentuckians made sport of them,
calling them &#8220;New Purchase greenies,&#8221; and
declaring that they of the southern side of the
river were a superior race, composed of &#8220;half-alligator,
half-horse, and tipped off with snapping
turtle!&#8221; Fighting grew out of these
boasts in the market-place and streets of Louisville.
An Indiana visitor who had heard
Lehmanowski lecture on &#8220;The Wars of Europe&#8221;
and been captivated by the prowess of the
Hussars, whipped one of the Kentuckians, and
bending over him cried, &#8220;I&#8217;m a Hoosier,&#8221; meaning,
&#8220;I&#8217;m a Hussar.&#8221; Mr. Woods adds that he
was living in the State at the time and that this
was the true origin of the term. This is, however,
hardly conclusive. The whole Lehmanowski
story seems to be based on communication
between Indiana and Kentucky workmen during
the building of the Ohio Falls Canal. The original<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span> canal
was completed in 1830; and as the
Polish soldier was not in this region earlier than
1840, ten years after the appearance of Finley&#8217;s
poem, it is clear that those who would reach the
truth of the matter must go back of &#8220;The Hoosier
Nest&#8221; to find secure ground. No one has ever
pretended that Finley originated the word, and
it is not at all likely that he did so; but his
poem gave it wide currency, and doubtless had
much to do with fixing it on the Indianians.
Bartlett, in his &#8220;Dictionary of Americanisms,&#8221;
gives the novel solution of the problem that the
men of superior strength throughout the early
West, the heroes of log-rollings and house-raisings,
were called &#8220;hushers&#8221; because of
their ability to hush or quiet their antagonists;
and that &#8220;husher&#8221; was a common term for a
bully. The Ohio River boatmen carried the
word to New Orleans, where a foreigner among
them, in attempting to apply the word to himself,
pronounced it &#8220;Hoosier.&#8221; Sulgrove may
have had this meaning in mind in citing his
Irishman, though he is not explicit. Hoosier as
a Christian name has been known in the Ohio
Valley; it was borne by a member of the Indiana<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
Methodist Conference in 1835. A Louisville
baker named Hoosier made a variety of sweet
bread which was so much affected by Indiana
people that they were called &#8220;Hoosier&#8217;s customers,&#8221;
&#8220;Hoosier&#8217;s men,&#8221; and so on; but
no date can be found for this. The Rev.
T. A. Goodwin, first heard the word at Cincinnati
in 1830, where it described a species
of gingerbread, but without reference to
Indiana.</p>

<p>It is clear that the cultivated people of Indiana
recognized the nickname in the early half
of the century. Wright and Smith, as mentioned
above, had sought to determine its
genesis; and Tilghman A. Howard, when a
congressman from Indiana, writing home to a
friend in 1840, spoke casually of the &#8220;Hoosier
State.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The word occurs familiarly in Hall&#8217;s
&#8220;New Purchase&#8221; (1855), and it is found also in
Beste&#8217;s rare volume, &#8220;The Wabash; or, Adventures
of an English Gentleman&#8217;s Family in the
Interior of America,&#8221; published at London in
the same year, and in Mrs. Beecher&#8217;s &#8220;From
Dawn to Daylight&#8221; (1859). And when, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
1867, Sandford C. Cox published a book of
verses containing the couplet,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;If Sam is right, I would suggest</div>
<div class="verse">A native Hoosier as the best,&#8221;&mdash;</div>
</div></div>

<p>the word was widely known, and thereafter it
frequently occurs in all printed records touching
the State. It is reported from Tennessee, Virginia,
and South Carolina by independent observers,
who say that the idea of a rough
countryman is always associated with it. In
Missouri it is sometimes used thus abstractly,
but a native Indianian is usually meant, without
reference to his manners or literacy.</p>

<p>No reader of Hoosier chronicles can fail
to be impressed by the relation of the great
forests to the people who came to possess and
tame them. Before they reached the Indiana
wilderness in their advance before civilization,
the stalwart pioneers had swung their axes in
Pennsylvania or Kentucky, and had felt the
influence of the great, gloomy woodlands in
their lives; but in Indiana this influence was
greatly intensified. They experienced an isolation
that is not possible to-day in any part of
the country, and the loss of nearly every civilizing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
agency that men value. These frontiersmen
could hardly have believed themselves the
founders of a permanent society, for the exact
topography of much of their inheritance was
unknown to them; large areas were submerged
for long periods, and the density of the woods
increased the difficulty of building roads and
knitting the scattered clearings and villages
into a compact and sensitive commonwealth.
Once cleared, the land yielded a precarious
living to the pioneers in return for their labors
and sacrifices; after the first dangers from
beasts of prey, the pestiferous small animals
anticipated the harvest and ate the corn. One
ear in four acres remained after the gray squirrels
had taken their pleasure in a Johnson
County field.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Sheep were out of the question
on account of the wolves; and always present
and continuing were the fevers that preyed on
the worn husbandmen and sent many to premature
graves. The women, deprived of every
comfort, contributed their share of the labor,
making homes of their cabins; dyeing the wool,
when they had it, with the ooze of the walnut,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
carding, spinning, and weaving it, and finally
cutting the cloth into garments; or if linen
were made, following the flax from the field
through all the processes of manufacture until
it clothed the family.</p>

<p>The pioneers could not see then, as their
children see now, that the wilderness was a
factor in their destiny; that it drove them in
upon themselves, strengthening their independence
in material things by shutting them off
from older communities, and that it even fastened
upon their tongues the peculiarities of
speech which they had brought with them into
the wilderness. But their isolation compelled
meditation, and when reading matter penetrated
the woodlands it was usually worth the trouble
of transportation in a day of few roads and
little travel. The pioneers knew their Bibles
and named their children for the Bible heroes,
and most of their other books were religious.
There have been worse places in which to form
habits of thought, and to lay the foundation for
a good manner of writing our language, than
the Hoosier cabin. Lying before the fireplace
in his father&#8217;s humble Spencer County home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
during the fourteen years that the family spent
in Indiana,&mdash;years that were of the utmost importance
in his life,&mdash;Abraham Lincoln studied
his few books and caught the elusive language-spirit
that later on gave character and beauty
to his utterances.</p>

<p>The social life of the first comers also drew
its inspiration from their environment, and
was expressed in log-rolling, house-raising,
and other labors that could best be done by
co&ouml;peration, and which they concluded usually,
in a fashion quite characteristic, with a
frolic. After the axe, the rifle was most
important among their belongings; for they
trusted largely to the fortunes of the hunt
for food; and peltries became a valuable
medium of exchange in their simple economy.
Expertness in the use of the rifle and friendly
rivalry in marksmanship among the settlers
led to other social gatherings; and even professional
men took pride in the sport and participated
in these contests. The militia system
in the early days was not an important feature
of Hoosier life. The Hoosier&#8217;s sense of
humor has always been keen, and where, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
once occurred on muster day in the White
Water country, a part of the officer&#8217;s duty
was to separate wearers of shoes from those
who appeared in moccasins, and bearers of
cornstalks from those who carried rifles, there
was nothing of the pomp and pageantry of
war to captivate the imagination of the people.</p>

<p>The Hoosier fiddle was a factor in all the
festivities of the country folk. The fiddler
was frequently an eccentric genius, ranking
with the rural poet, who was often merely a
maker of idle rhymes; however, the country
fiddler in Indiana has held his own against
latter-day criticism and the competition of the
village brass band. Governor Whitcomb enjoyed
local fame as a violinist, and Berry
Sulgrove and General Lew Wallace, in their
younger years, were skilful with the bow.
Dr. H. W. Taylor, a conscientious student of
early Hoosier customs, connects the Hoosier
fiddler with the Scotch Highlanders, and has
expressed his belief<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> that the Highlander folk
coming to the United States naturally sought
the mountain country of Virginia, North Carolina,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
Tennessee, and Georgia, and that the
Scotch fiddle and its traditions survive principally
in these mountainous countries. We are
told that the fiddle of the Hoosiers is an exotic
and cannot long survive, though fifteen years
after this prediction a contest of Hoosier
fiddlers was held in the largest hall at Indianapolis,
and many musicians of this old school
appeared from the back districts to compete
for the prizes. The great aim of the old time
fiddlers was to make their instruments &#8220;talk.&#8221;
Their tunes enjoyed such euphonious names
as &#8220;Old Dan Tucker,&#8221; &#8220;Old Zip Coon,&#8221;
&#8220;Possum up a Gum Stump,&#8221; &#8220;Irish Washerwoman,&#8221;
&#8220;Waggoner,&#8221; &#8220;Ground Spy,&#8221; and
&#8220;Jay Bird.&#8221; Dr. Taylor discovered that the
very Hoosier manner of bowing, <i>i.e.</i> fiddling,
was derived from the Scotch, and he gives
this description of it: &#8220;The arm, long, bony,
and sinewy, was stretched forwards, downwards,
and outwards from the shoulder, and at
full length. There was absolutely no movement
of the wrist, a very little at the elbow, and just
a degree more at the shoulder.&#8221; Hall ironically
observed that the country fiddler could,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
like Paganini, play one tune or parts of nearly
two dozen tunes on one string; and like the
great <i>maestro</i> he played without notes, and with
endless flourishes. He gives this attractive portrait
of one of the New Purchase fiddlers:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;He held his fiddle against his breast&mdash;perhaps out of
affection&mdash;and his bow in the middle, and like a cart-whip;
things enabling him, however, the more effectually
to flog his instrument when rebellious: and the afflicted
creature would scream right out in agony! Indeed, his
Scremonah bore marks of premature old age&mdash;its fingerboard
being indented with little pits, and its stomach was
frightfully incrusted with rosin and other gummy things,
till it looked as dark and careworn as Methuselah! Dan
was, truly, no niggard of &#8216;rosum,&#8217; for he &#8216;greased&#8217; as he
termed it, between his tunes every time! and then, at his
first few vigorous jerks, fell a shower of dust on the agitated
bosom of his instrument, calling out in vain for mercy
under the cruel punishment.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>
</div>

<p>James Whitcomb Riley corroborates the impression
of earlier writers in a characteristic
poem, &#8220;My Fiddle:&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>In several of the Southern Indiana counties
the least admirable traits of the ancestors of the
&#8220;poor whites&#8221; who came in from the South
have been continued into a third and fourth generation;
but these do not appear prominently
in any fair or comprehensive examination of the
people. Much has been written of the lawlessness
of Indianians, and lynching and white-capping
have sporadically been reported from
many of the southern counties. An attorney-general
of the State who had brought all the
machinery of the law to bear upon particular
instances of lynching during his term of office,
and who had given much study to the phenomena
presented by these outbreaks, expressed his
opinion that the right of way of the Baltimore
and Southwestern Railway marked the &#8220;lynching
belt&#8221; in Indiana. Statistics in confirmation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
are lacking, but it is safe to say that a large
percentage of the lynchings reported in the
State have occurred either in counties on the line
of the road or in those immediately adjoining.
Lynchings have also occurred in at least half
a dozen counties north of Indianapolis, so that
all the crimes of this sort perpetrated in Indiana
cannot be charged to the descendants of the
&#8220;poor whites&#8221; in the more Southern counties.
Lynching has not been viewed with apathy, and
every instance of it has been followed by vigorous
efforts at punishment. In 1889 a drastic
law was added to the statutes, defining lynching
and providing severe penalties. It struck to
the quick of the matter by making possible the
impeachment of law officers who yield prisoners
to a mob. But under any circumstances
these people are so intensely clannish that even
the sincerest prosecution usually fails for lack
of witnesses. The Hon. W. A. Ketcham, State
attorney-general, after heroic efforts to fix responsibility
for the lynching of five men in Ripley
County on the night of September 14, 1898,
gravely stated in his official report that he had
applied the Sherlock Holmes principle to the incident;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
that is to say, after excluding every other
possible hypothesis he had assumed the correctness
of the one remaining, and this he stated
in his syllabus of the case to be: &#8220;That A
broke jail and travelled across the country to the
town where the revolver had been pawned, a
distance of seven miles, broke into the store,
stole the revolver, returned again, broke back
into jail, shot himself, then killed B and C and
hung their dead bodies to a tree, put the finishing
touches to his crime by hanging D and E, and
then in order that suspicion might be directed
against innocent men, finally hanged himself.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
The milder form of outlawry, known as &#8220;white-capping,&#8221;
has also been practised in Indiana
occasionally, and sometimes with barbarous
cruelty; but it, like lynching, is not peculiar to
the State, and its extent has been greatly exaggerated
by Eastern newspapers.</p>

<p>It has been insisted by loyal Indianians that
the speech of the later generations of natives is
almost normal English; that the rough vernacular
of their ancestors has been ground down
in the schools, and that the dictionaries are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
rapidly sanctioning new words, once without
authority, that inevitably crept into common
speech through the necessities of pioneer expression.
It may fairly be questioned whether,
properly speaking, there ever existed a Hoosier
dialect. The really indigenous Indiana
words and novel pronunciations are so few as to
make but a poor showing when collected; and
while the word &#8220;dialect&#8221; is employed as a
term of convenience in this connection, it can
only be applied to a careless manner of speaking,
in which novel words are merely incidental.
A book of colloquial terms, like Green&#8217;s &#8220;Virginia
Word Book,&#8221; could hardly be compiled
for Indiana without infringing upon the prior
claims of other and older States to the greater
part of it. The so-called Hoosier dialect, where
it survives at all, is the speech of the first
American settlers in Indiana, greatly modified
by time and schooling, but retaining, both in the
employment of colloquial terms and in pronunciation,
the peculiarities that were carried westward
from tide water early in the nineteenth
century. The distinctive Indiana countryman,
the real Hoosier, who has been little in contact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
with the people of cities, speaks a good deal
as his Pennsylvania or North Carolina or Kentucky
grandfather or great-grandfather did before
him, and has created nothing new. His
speech contains comparatively few words that
are peculiar to the State or to communities
within it; but in the main it shares such deviations
from normal or literary English with the
whole Southwest.</p>

<p>In his book &#8220;The Wabash&#8221; Beste describes
his interview with an Indiana carpenter, who
questioned whether the traveller was really an
Englishman, because his speech was unlike
that of the usual English immigrants whose
trouble with the aspirate had evoked derisive
comment among the Americans. This occurs
in his chapter on Indianapolis, in which the
carpenter is quoted thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You do not say &#8216;ouse&#8217; and &#8216;and&#8217; for &#8216;house&#8217; and
&#8216;hand&#8217;; all the children, and all of you, pronounce all
these words like Americans, and not as real English pronounce
them. Their way of speaking makes us always
say that we talk better English than the English themselves.&#8217;
I had, indeed, often heard the Americans laughed
at for saying so; but now the matter was explained. My
carpenter repeated with great accuracy various instances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
of provincialisms and vulgarisms which he and all of them
had noticed more or less, in all the English emigrants who
had come amongst them. Seeing none of any other class,
they naturally supposed that all English people pronounced
the language in the same manner, and so prided themselves
upon the superiority of American English. For
notwithstanding the disagreeable nasal tone and drawling
whine in which most of them speak, and notwithstanding
a few national phrases and the peculiar use and pronunciation
of certain words, it must be admitted that the American
people, in general, speak English without provincial
dialect or vulgarisms. Whence, in fact, could they acquire
such, since all the emigrants they see came from
different parts of England, and the provincialisms of the
one neutralize those of the other.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Professor Whitney, in his &#8220;Language and
the Study of Language,&#8221; expresses in academic
terms much the same idea.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Lapses in pronunciation have never been
punishable with death on the Wabash, as at
the fords of the Jordan, where the shibboleth
test of the Gileadites cost the Ephraimites forty
and two thousand. The native Indianian is
not sensitive about his speech and refuses to be
humble before critics from the far East who
say &#8220;idea-r&#8221; and &#8220;Philadelphia-r.&#8221; James Whitcomb<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
Riley has made the interesting and just
observation that the average countryman knows
in reality a wider range of diction than he permits
himself to use, and that his abridgments
and variations are attributable to a fear lest
he may offend his neighbors by using the best
language at his command.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> This is wholly
true, and it is responsible in a measure for contributions
to the common speech of local idioms
and phrases. In rural Indiana and generally
in the Southwest the phrase &#8220;&#8217;s th&#8217; fellah says&#8221;
is often used by a rustic to indicate his own
appreciation of the fact that he has employed
an unusual expression. Or it may be an actual
quotation, as, for example, &#8220;Come over fer a
visit, an&#8217; we&#8217;ll treat you &#8217;n a hostile manner,
&#8217;s Uncle Amos use t&#8217; say.&#8221; This substitution
of hostile for hospitable once enjoyed wide currency
in Indiana and Illinois. Sulgrove confirms
Riley&#8217;s impression:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Correct pronunciation was positively regarded by the
Southern immigration as a mark of aristocracy or, as
they called it, &#8216;quality.&#8217; The &#8216;ing&#8217; in &#8216;evening,&#8217; or
&#8216;morning&#8217; or any other words, was softened into &#8216;in,&#8217; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
full sound being held finical and &#8216;stuck up.&#8217; So it was no
unusual thing to hear such a comical string of emasculated
&#8216;nasals&#8217; as the question of a prominent Indiana lawyer
of the Kentucky persuasion, &#8216;Where were you a-standin&#8217;
at the time of your perceivin&#8217; of the hearin&#8217; of the firin&#8217; of
the pistol?&#8217;... To &#8216;set&#8217; was the right way to sit; an
Indian did not scalp, he &#8216;skelped&#8217;: a child did not long
for a thing, he &#8216;honed&#8217; for it,&mdash;slang retains this Hoosier
archaism; a woman was not dull, she was &#8216;daunsy&#8217;; commonly
a gun was &#8216;shot&#8217; instead of fired in all moods and
tenses.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>
</div>

<p>While the French settlements in Indiana made
no appreciable impression on the common speech,
yet it has been assumed by some observers that
the inclination at the South to throw the accent
of words forward, as in gentle<i>men</i>, settle<i>ment</i>,
was fairly attributable to the influence of the
French Catholics in Louisiana and of the Huguenots
who were scattered through the Southeastern
colonies, though this would seem a trifle
finespun; but the idiosyncrasy noted exists
at the South, no matter what its real origin
may have been, and it has been communicated
in some measure through Southern influences
to the middle Western people. However, Southern
Indianians sometimes say <i>Tennes</i>-sy, accenting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
the first syllable and slurring the last,
illustrating again the danger of accepting any
theories or fixing any rules for general guidance
in such matters. Dr. Eggleston remembers
only one French word that survived from old
French times in the Wabash country,&mdash;&#8220;cordelle,
to tow a boat by a rope carried along the
shore.&#8221; The most striking influence in the
Indiana dialect is that of the Scotch-Irish, who
have left marked peculiarities of speech behind
them wherever they have gone. Notwithstanding
the fact that both the English Quakers and
the Germans contributed largely to the settlement
of Pennsylvania and of the Southeastern
colonies, the idiosyncrasies of speech most perceptible
in the regions deriving their population
from those sources are plainly Scotch-Irish; as,
for example, the linguistic deficiency which
makes <i>strenth</i> and <i>lenth</i> of <i>strength</i> and <i>length</i>,
or <i>bunnle</i> of <i>bundle</i>, and the use of <i>nor</i> for <i>than</i>,
after a comparative adjective. The use of <i>into</i>
for <i>in</i> and <i>whenever</i> for <i>as soon as</i> are other
Scotch-Irish peculiarities. These, however, are
heard only in diminishing degree in Indiana, and
many of the younger generations of Hoosiers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
have never known them. The confusion of <i>shall</i>
and <i>will</i> and of <i>like</i> and <i>as</i> is traceable to North-Irish
influences, and is not peculiar to the spoken
language at the South and West, but is observed
frequently in the newspapers, and is found even
in books.</p>

<p>The anonymous writer of &#8220;Pioneer Annals&#8221;
(1875), a rare pamphlet that contains much
invaluable matter relating to the occupation
of the White Water Valley, speaks of the prevalence
of Carolina Quakers among the first
settlers of that region, and remarks that when
newcomers were asked where they came from,
the answer would be &#8220;Guilford County, near
Clemmens&#8217;s Store&#8221;; or &#8220;Beard&#8217;s Hatter-shop&#8221;;
&#8220;Dobson&#8217;s Cross Roads&#8221;; or &#8220;Deep-River
Settlement of Friends.&#8221; The same writer gives
a dialect note which illustrates the ephemeral
character of idiom. <i>Sleys</i> (slays) was a term
applied by the Carolinians to the reeds used
by them in their home-made looms. A Carolina
emigrant bound for Indiana stopped at
Cincinnati and offered to sell a supply of these.
It was in August, and the storekeeper knew
but one word having the same sound, sleighs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
which were not used in Cincinnati in midsummer.
His ironical comment almost led
to a personal encounter before the Carolinian
could explain. John V. Hadley states in his
&#8220;Seven Months a Prisoner&#8221; that &#8220;Guilford
County&#8221; and &#8220;Jamestown&#8221; (North Carolina)
were household words in many families of Hendricks
County (Indiana), where he lived. At
Jamestown, on his way to Libby Prison, he
was accosted by a citizen who asked whether
a former neighbor who had moved to Indiana,
but still owned property in North Carolina,
had not enlisted in the Union army, the purpose
of the inquiry being to obtain testimony on
which to confiscate his estate.</p>

<p>The circulation of newly coined words has
been so rapid in late years, owing to the increase
of communication between different
parts of the country, and to dissemination by
the newspapers, that few useful words originating
obscurely are likely to remain local.
Lowell amused himself by tracing to unassailable
English sources terms that were assumed
to be essentially American; and if Chaucer
and the Elizabethans may be invoked against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
our rural communities, the word-hunter&#8217;s sport
has grown much simpler when he may cite
a usage in one State to disestablish the priority
claimed for it in another. There is risk
in all efforts to connect novel words with particular
communities, no matter how carefully
it may be done, and it is becoming more and
more difficult to separate real dialect from
slang. Lists of unusual words that have been
reported to the American Dialect Society
afford interesting instances of the danger of
accepting terms as local which are really in
general use. The word <i>rambunctious</i>, reported
from New York State as expressing impudence
and forwardness, cannot be peculiar
to that region,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> for it is used in Indiana in
identically the same sense. Other words, collected
through the same agency and common
in Indiana, are: <i>scads</i>, reported from Missouri,
signifying a great quantity; and <i>sight</i>,
meaning a large amount, noted in New England
and New York. <i>Great hand for</i>, meaning
a <i>penchant</i>, traced from Maine to Ohio,
may be followed also into Indiana, but this,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
like <i>druthers</i>, for a preference or choice, belongs
to the towns rather than to the country.
<i>Go like</i>, in the sense of imitation, as &#8220;<i>go
like</i> a rooster,&#8221; is reported from both Maine
and Indiana; and <i>foot-loose</i>, meaning free and
untrammelled, observed in Georgia, is used
in the towns, at least, of Indiana. The natural
disposition of Americans to exaggerate led to
the creation by the Southeastern element in
Indiana population of <i>bodaciously</i>,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> a corruption
of audaciously; and to the employment of <i>powerful</i>,
indiscriminately with <i>big</i> or <i>little</i>, as a
particularly emphatic superlative. Curiously
enough <i>powerful</i>, which is usually identified
with the earlier generations of the Southwest,
is reported also from Eastern Massachusetts.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
<i>Sarcumstansis</i> for <i>circumstances</i>, <i>b&#8217;ar</i> for <i>bear</i>,
and <i>thar</i> for <i>there</i> reached Indiana through Kentucky,
and are now rarely heard. Dr. Eggleston
employs the broad <i>a</i> in &#8220;The Graysons,&#8221;
where one character says <i>bar</i> while another
pronounces the word correctly, explaining that
words are not always pronounced the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
in a dialect&mdash;an observation that has also
been made by Mr. Riley.</p>

<p>Mrs. Henry Ward Beecher, whose unamiable
novel, &#8220;From Dawn to Daylight,&#8221; is a dreary
picture of Indiana life, gives a few interesting
usages; as <i>a right smart chance of money</i>,
<i>heap of plunder</i>, <i>sight stronger</i>, <i>proper hard</i>,
showing that her acquaintance was principally
with the Southern element, which she
had known at Lawrenceburg and Indianapolis.
<i>Plunder</i>, as a synonym for baggage, seems to
be largely Southern and Western, and was
probably derived from the Pennsylvania Germans.
The insolent intrusiveness of dialect
is illustrated by the appearance of the word
in its colloquial sense in the first chapter of
General Wallace&#8217;s &#8220;Prince of India.&#8221; Dr.
Eggleston in &#8220;The Graysons&#8221; gives <i>weth</i> for
<i>with</i>, <i>air</i> for <i>are</i>, <i>thes</i> for <i>just</i>, <i>sher&#8217;f</i> for
<i>sheriff</i>, and <i>yer&#8217;s</i> for <i>here is</i>. Indianians usually
pronounce the name of their State correctly,
though the final vowel sometimes becomes <i>y</i>.
Benjamin S. Parker remembers that in the
early days pioneers sometimes said <i>Injuns</i>,
<i>Injiana</i>, and <i>immejut</i>; but these usages are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
obsolete in the State.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Mr. Riley frequently
uses <i>miled</i> (mile), and yet the word is somewhat
similarly spoken on Nantucket, <i>maild</i>.
<i>Ornery</i>, a vulgar form of ordinary, seems to
be generally used, and has been observed in
the Middle States as well as in Indiana and
Kentucky. The injunction <i>mind out</i>, which
is used in Kentucky in such admonitions as
&#8220;<i>mind out</i> what you are doing,&#8221; becomes
<i>watch out</i> in Indiana. <i>Wrench</i> for <i>rinse</i>, used
in the States contiguous to the Ohio, is <i>rense</i>
in New England. <i>Critter</i> for <i>horse</i> is still
heard in parts of rural Indiana, which derived
population through Kentucky, where the same
usage is noted. <i>Fruit</i>, as applied to stewed
apples (apple sauce) only, is a curious limitation
of the noun, heard among old-fashioned
people of Southern origin in Indiana. <i>Some
place</i> for <i>somewhere</i> is not chargeable to Indiana
alone, but this and the phrases <i>want on</i>
and <i>want off</i> seem to be used chiefly in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
West Central States, and they belong to the
borderland between slang and dialect. It
would seem a far cry from the Hoosier speech
to the classic Greek, and yet Dr. H. W. Taylor
has pursued this line of philological inquiry
with astonishing results, tracing an analogy
of sound and sense most ingeniously between
Greek terms and words found in the American
dialects.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>In the speech of the illiterate, there is usually
something of rhythm and cadence. All
slang shares a feeling for the balance and
nice adjustment of words, and slang phrases
are rarely clumsy. The cry of a boy calling
his mate has its peculiar crescendo, and pedlers
the world over run the scale of human
expression in pursuit of odd effects. The
drawl of the Southerner and Southwesterner is
not unmusical, though it may try the patience
of the stranger. Even cultivated Indianians,
particularly those of Southern antecedents,
have the habit of clinging to their words;
they do not bite them off sharply. <i>G</i> performs
its office as final consonant in <i>ing</i> under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
many disadvantages; and it was long ignored,
though the school-teachers have struggled
nobly to restore it. The blending of words,
which begins with childhood, is often carried
into maturity by the Indianian; thus by a
lazy elision &#8220;did you ever&#8221; is combined in
<i>jever</i>, and &#8220;where did you get&#8221; becomes
<i>wherjuget</i>. <i>Ju</i> is, in fact, usual in the Ohio
Valley. The history of the Italian <i>a</i> in
this country is in itself interesting. In New
England and in Virginia it finds recognition,
whereas in the intermediate region the narrower
sound of the vowel prevails; and likewise
the softening of <i>r</i> is noted in New
England and among the Virginians and other
Southerners, while in the intermediate territory
and at the West <i>r</i> receives its full sound.
The shrill nasal tone is still marked in the
back country folk of New England, while the
Southern and Southwestern farmer&#8217;s speech
is fuller and more open-mouthed. Whether
climatic influences have been potent in such
matters remains a matter of speculation, but
such theories are to be received with caution.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that there are so few trustworthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
records of the early Southwestern
speech, and that first and last bad grammar,
reckless spelling, and the indiscriminate distribution
of the printer&#8217;s apostrophe by writers
who had no real knowledge to guide them,
have served to create an erroneous impression
of the illiteracy of the Indianians and their
neighbors. It is likely that during the next
quarter of a century the continued fusion of
the various elements of Western population
will create a dead level of speech, approximating
accuracy, so that in a typical American
State like Indiana local usages will disappear,
and the only oddities discernible will be those
of the well-nigh universal slang, which even
now reach Colorado and California almost as
soon as they are known at the Atlantic seaboard.
At the South and in New England,
where there is less mingling of elements, the
old usages will probably endure much longer;
and it is a fair assumption that in the Mississippi
Valley and in the Trans-Missouri country,
a normal American speech free of local idiosyncrasies
will appear first. Our keen sense
of humor and our love of the conveniences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
of speech are likely to continue to be national
traits, leading to the creation and adoption of
slang from time to time; but where a people
imply quotation marks in all their lapses from
propriety, they anticipate and destroy criticism.</p>

<p>After all, there is nothing reprehensible in
dialect, as we loosely use the word, or even
in slang. Flexibility is necessary to the living
language; and the word-hunter who really
delights in his avocation, and is not limited in
his researches to the remoter fields of classical
philology, hearing in his daily walks and
in the tranquil talk at peaceful inns the pungent
or pictorial word that no lexicographer
has yet detected, knows a joy that is greater
than that of fly fishing or butterfly hunting.
&#8220;No language,&#8221; writes Lowell, &#8220;after it has
faded into diction, none that cannot suck up
the feeding juices secreted for it in the rich
mother-earth of common folk, can bring forth
a sound and lusty book. True vigor and
heartiness of phrase do not pass from page
to page, but from man to man, where the
brain is kindled and the lips suppled by downright
living interests, and by passion in its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
very throe.&#8221; He continues: &#8220;Language is
the soil of thought, and our own especially
is a rich leaf-mould, the slow deposit of ages,
the shed foliage of feeling, fancy, and imagination,
which has suffered an earth change,
that the vocal forest, as Howell called it, may
clothe itself anew with living green.&#8221; And this
suggests Horace&#8217;s words, in &#8220;Ars Poetica&#8221;:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Ut silvae foliis pronos mutantur in annos,</div>
<div class="verse">Prima cadunt; ita verborum vetus interit aetas,</div>
<div class="verse">Et juvenum ritu florent modo nata vigentque.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>As the leaves have fallen through a century
in the Wabash country, they have buried words
that will never reappear; and the change will
continue, old words vanishing and new ones
taking their places, so long as tradition and
heredity yield to the schoolmaster, that ruthless
forester who grafts and trims to make all trees
uniform.</p>

<small>BRINGERS OF THE LIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> his address to the annual council of the
Protestant Episcopal diocese of Indiana in 1863,
Bishop Upfold spoke with much vigor against
the use of flowers in the decoration of churches,
and said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;There is no sound principle, no true doctrine involved
in the practice. It is all poetry, and the very romance
of poetry, the conception of romantic and imaginative
minds, dictated less by religious sentiment than by a fondness
for show and gaudy display. Instead of the decoration
concentrating the attention devoutly on the great and
glorious fact which flowers are erroneously supposed to
symbolize, it is far more likely to divert it, and impair the
true spiritual emotions and impressions, which the commemorative
services of the day (Easter) are destined to
awaken and deepen.... The practice will not be
allowed in this diocese; and I now declare and desire
it may be distinctly understood and remembered,&mdash;and
I may as well say it, because I mean to do it&mdash;that I
will not visit or officiate in any parish, to administer confirmation,
or perform any other office on Easter Sunday,
or on any other occasion, where this floral display is
attempted.&#8221;</p>
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>Bishop Upfold greatly modified his views
before his death, in 1872; but this declaration
is expressive of the general religious
attitude of the earlier Indianians; it was Protestant,
intensely Protestant. The religious phenomena
observable in the State are not complex
and are readily explained. The early French
were, of course, Roman Catholics, and their
first priests were of the heroic type that had its
highest expression in Marquette and Joliet, and
hardly less notably in Father Sorin of the Order
of the Holy Cross, who founded, in Northern
Indiana, Notre Dame University, and lived to
see it one of the great Catholic schools of the
continent. But the prevalent religious ideas
of the Hoosiers were not inherited from the
early French settlers. North Carolina contributed
members of the Society of Friends to the
new territory, and Virginia, Kentucky, and
Pennsylvania sent Methodists, Presbyterians, and
Baptists, members of the sect established by
Alexander Campbell, and German Lutherans.
Episcopalians were few among the first Indiana
colonists. The diocese of Indiana was created
in 1838, and many earnest men have given their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
labor to its service first and last; but the slow
progress of the Episcopal Church in the commonwealth
has been due to conditions antedating the
settlement of the Ohio Valley, running back,
indeed, to the efforts of James I. to establish
Scotch and English colonies in Ireland, the most
turbulent part of his kingdom, and thus forming
the base for a migration to America that was
to color the life and thought of a vast area of
new soil. As so large a proportion of the
pioneers had rejected apostolic succession in
the Old World, they saw no reason for accepting
it in the Western wilderness. The rugged
apostles of Methodism, and the less rugged
but equally diligent and earnest preachers of
Presbyterianism, were leaders in the strenuous
religious labors of the early years of the century.
The advance guard of these two religious
bodies did not always dwell together in unity;
in educational work, for example, envy, hatred,
and malice were sometimes awakened. The
Rev. F. C. Holliday, writing in 1872,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> complained
of the self-complacency with which the
leading Presbyterians at the West had assumed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
authority in educational matters, and &#8220;the quiet
unscrupulousness with which they seized upon
the trust funds of the States for school purposes,
and made these schools as strictly denominational
as though the funds had been exclusively
contributed by members of their own communion.&#8221;
It is true that Presbyterians controlled
the State University in its early years,
but this was due to their zeal in education
and to the exceptional fitness of many Presbyterian
clergymen for teaching. Princeton extended
a friendly hand to the Presbyterians who
were struggling in the new State, and sent, among
others, the Rev. George Bush (1796-1859), who
reached Indianapolis in 1824, and two years
later shocked his congregation in the malarious
village by denying that there was any authority
of Scripture for the Presbyterian form of church
government.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> His views became increasingly
radical and in 1829 he left Indiana, accepted the
chair of Hebrew and Oriental Literature in the
University of the City of New York, and became
a Swedenborgian. He was a life-long
student and a writer of recognized ability.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>The Baptists organized the first Protestant
church in Indiana in 1798. The Methodists
formed a society in 1803, and in 1805 Peter
Cartwright, one of the great pioneer Methodist
evangelists, was at work in the State.
The oldest Presbyterian society was formed
in 1806, near Vincennes, then the capital, and
William Henry Harrison, the governor, who
had married a Presbyterian wife, was numbered
among its parishioners.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The very nature
of the pioneer life compelled the simplest of
religious as well as of social observances.
The meeting-houses were of logs, and the
ministers were often tillers of the soil. One
of the early Presbyterian clergymen aided the
support of his family by farming, writing the
deeds, wills, and other formal papers of his
neighbors, by teaching singing, and by making
shoes, and from all these sources of labor,
including his pay as minister, he averaged
only $80 a year for a period of sixteen
years. Father (the Rev. James) Havens,
one of the famous apostles of Methodism,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
who, in 1824, rode what was known as the
Connersville circuit, embracing several county
seats, received $56.06&frac12; for his year&#8217;s services.
This does not indicate indifference among the
scattered flock, but a lack of actual money.
Instances are reported of men splitting rails
or working in the harvest field at fifty cents
a day in order to aid their ministers. Meetings
were held in wayside cabins, in which
the near neighbors gathered, and after the
service the housewife prepared a meal for the
clerical guest, and for those of the little congregation
who remained. The ministers of
the day were not always profound scholars,
but they were light-bearers, who went ahead
of the schoolmasters, communicating to scores
of the youth of the new land an interest in
the world of men and books. It has been
said that three-fourths of the early students
of Asbury (DePauw) University came from
homes that were visited by the itinerant
Methodist preachers.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Ministers were required to be extemporaneous
speakers, and they often indulged in joint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
debates that aroused the greatest interest.
These contests were markedly frequent during
the period in which the &#8220;Campbellite&#8221;
movement gathered force and began to attract
members of the older religious societies.
Lay discussion was common, and the free
interpretation of the Bible urged by the
Campbellites encouraged it. &#8220;Revivals&#8221; and
camp-meetings were conducted frequently, and
were often attended with great excitement.
During the first quarter of the century religious
enthusiasm manifested itself with an excess
and abandon that were unknown in politics.
&#8220;Father&#8221; was often prefixed to the names of
the venerable pioneer ministers as a mark of
affection, and in recognition of long service.
This was not unusual among the Methodists,
and even the Presbyterians occasionally bestowed
the term on some of their old and
worn missionaries of the early days. Many
of these men lived until late in the century,
and saw the theology of their young manhood
altered or superseded, and amid new men
and new manners became almost strangers in
the land they had first known as a wilderness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>Great care had been taken to assure to the
Northwest religious liberty and free schools.
The ordinance of 1787 touched directly on
the questions of religion and education in the
Northwest Territory. &#8220;No person,&#8221; it declared,
&#8220;demeaning himself in a peaceable,
orderly manner shall ever be molested on
account of his mode of worship or religious
sentiments in the said territory;&#8221; and &#8220;religion,
morality and knowledge being necessary
to good government and the happiness of
mankind, schools and the means of education
shall be forever encouraged.&#8221; The ordinance
has clearly been one of the great guiding
influences of the nation. It prepared the way
in the Ohio Valley for the attitude of the
people toward slavery; and its assurance of
religious freedom and friendliness to learning
brought to the new territory the benefit of
the experience of those who had striven for
such liberties and advantages in the seaboard
colonies. The history of civilization in Indiana
may be said to date from its passage. When,
in 1804, Congress provided for the disposal
of public lands in the districts of Detroit,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
Kaskaskia, and Vincennes, the act carried with
it a reservation of the sixteenth section in
each township for the support of schools, and
also an entire township in each land district
for the use of a seminary of learning; and
later, the act of 1816 that raised Indiana
Territory to statehood, provided &#8220;that one
entire township, which shall be designated by
the President of the United States, in addition
to the one heretofore reserved for that
purpose, shall be reserved for the use of a
seminary of learning, to be appropriated solely
to the use of such seminary.&#8221; Under the first
law Albert Gallatin, Secretary of the Treasury,
selected a township in Gibson County; and,
following further the direction of Congress,
Governor Harrison approved, in 1806, an act
of the territorial legislature, incorporating Vincennes
University, which was not, however,
fully open until 1810. The territorial legislators
believed that it would serve a good
purpose to admit Indian youth to the privileges
of the school, and the law enjoined the
trustees &#8220;to use their utmost endeavors to
induce the said aborigines to send their children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
to the University for education, who,
when sent, shall be maintained, clothed, and
educated at the expense of said institution.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
Only one Indian ever availed himself of this
offer. In 1822 a law was enacted calling for
the sale of the Gibson County lands and the
use of the proceeds for the State seminary
already planned at Bloomington. Thus the
State boldly confiscated the fief of one institution
and turned it over to another&mdash;an
act that led to long litigation; and though
Vincennes University was partially successful
in the courts, its revenue was curtailed and permanent
injury resulted. It continues, however,
in spite of reverses a lively member of the company
of Indiana schools of the preparatory type.</p>

<p>Under the act of 1816 President Monroe
designated Perry Township, in the county
which was named for him when, in 1818,
Orange County was divided.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> The selection
of the &#8220;seminary township&#8221; became of great
importance, for it determined not merely the
location of the contemplated seminary, but of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
the State University, into which it grew.
Efforts have been made repeatedly to remove
the institution from Bloomington, the town
that rose about it; but they have been unavailing.
The site chosen by President Monroe,
as it was impossible for him to foresee, was
not to remain the most fortunate in point
of convenience and accessibility; but Monroe
County has clung tenaciously to the honor
conferred upon her, and seems destined to
carry her dignity through the twentieth century.
The first principal of the seminary was
Baynard Rush Hall (1798-1865), the son of
a Philadelphia physician. He was a graduate
of Union College and of Princeton Theological
Seminary. He was not only an early
and valuable teacher, but a pioneer author.
One of his books &#8220;The New Purchase; or
Seven and a Half Years in the Far West&#8221;
contains a vast amount of information touching
pioneer customs; and while it is not always
wholly good-natured, it is written in the main
with spirit and humor.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> He declared his belief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
that he was &#8220;the very first man since the
creation of the world that read Greek in
the New Purchase&#8221;; which is extravagant, as
many of the earlier Protestant ministers were
doubtless learned in the languages, even if
the distinction of which he boasted did not
belong to some Roman Catholic missionary.
Ten boys and young men were all that were
admitted to the new seminary when it opened,
May 1, 1824. The standards of admission
seemed wholly novel and unnecessary. &#8220;Daddy
says he doesn&#8217;t see no sort a use in the high
larn&#8217;d things, and he wants me to larn Inglish
only, and book-keepin&#8217;, and surveyin&#8217;, so as
to &#8217;tend store and run a line,&#8221; was the tone
of protest heard from many applicants, as
reported by Hall in the &#8220;New Purchase.&#8221;
Local politicians, viewing the new school as
something exclusive and aristocratic, declared
that &#8220;it was a right smart chance better to
have no college nohow, if all folks hadn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
equal right to larn what they most liked best.&#8221;
Hall was the sole teacher employed for the
first three years, and during this period the
only branches taught were Greek and Latin.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
While he thus filled all the offices of the
seminary in the woods, he organized his handful
of students into a literary society, which
he called the <i>Henodelphisterian</i>, and for which
he made the rule that members should drop
their proper appellations while in the academic
shades and assume Greek or Latin names.
&#8220;Thus,&#8221; says Judge Banta, in his reminiscences,
&#8220;every member of the society was an
Ajax, a Pericles, a Timoleon.&#8221; Hall&#8217;s salary
at this time was two hundred and fifty dollars
a year, and there is ground for the suspicion
that he compensated himself for deficiencies
of income by the free indulgence of his sense
of humor. As the young gentlemen of the
<i>Henodelphisterian</i> were occupied out of school
hours in wood-chopping and swine-herding, the
joke was rather broad. Additional instruction
was demanded in the third year, and a teacher
of mathematics was employed. The seminary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
became the State University in 1838, and
among the first trustees were David Wallace,
Governor William Hendricks, Jesse L. Holman,
Robert Dale Owen, and Richard W. Thompson,
all of whom were otherwise factors in
the early history of the State, and in several
cases members of families distinguished in
subsequent generations. The University&#8217;s influence
in the State has been inestimable.
It has usually been fortunate in its administrators,
and it has more and more grown to
be the centre of agencies related to the better
life and advancement of the commonwealth.
After leaving Indiana, in 1831, Hall taught
academies at Bordentown and Trenton, New
Jersey, at Poughkeepsie and Newburgh, New
York, and in 1852 he became principal of Park
Institute, Brooklyn. He received the degree
of A.M. from Princeton and of D.D. from
Rutgers College.</p>

<p>So early as 1793 W. Rivet, a French missionary,
&#8220;a polite, well-educated, and liberal-minded
enthusiast, banished to this country by the
French Revolution,&#8221; had conducted a school
successfully at Vincennes. A system of county<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
seminaries was introduced early in the nineteenth
century, and such schools were organized
in about half of the counties; and between 1825
and 1850 seventy-three private and incorporated
schools were opened, traces of which remain.
These were known sometimes by the name of
the founder, or were identified with the name
of the town in which they were situated. The
democratic idea that secondary and higher education
could not properly be provided by the
State found early and wide acceptance. It
was believed that the obligation of higher education
should be undertaken by private enterprise
and by religious organizations; and out of
this spirit came a group of seminaries, similar
to those of the counties, and representing the
several churches that had established outposts
on the frontier. Many of these grew into
colleges. Hanover and Wabash colleges thus
began under Presbyterian auspices, DePauw
(Asbury) University under the Methodists, and
Franklin College under the Baptists; and while
their beginnings were not strictly in the seminary,
Notre Dame, a Catholic university, and
Earlham College, an institution of high character<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
allied to the Society of Friends, were of
like origin. Late in the period during which
the seminaries flourished there rose a number
of schools for women, of the academic grade,
and all of them private or denominational.</p>

<p>Institutions for higher education often precede
schools for primary and intermediate training;
and in Indiana care had been taken to provide
seminaries and colleges before the important
matter of establishing a common school system
had received intelligent attention. David Starr
Jordan, long identified with education in Indiana,
has remarked that &#8220;the growth in educational
systems is from above downwards. In
historical sequence Oxford must precede Rugby,
and the German University must come before
the gymnasium.&#8221; Nearly half a century after
the organization of the first territorial government,
no system of common schools had been
perfected in Indiana. Efforts had been made
and the subject had not been wholly overlooked
by the lawmakers, but a prejudice existed in the
minds of many against free schools as undemocratic.
The principle that enlightenment must
be a condition precedent to the intelligent exercise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
of citizenship was not grasped by the populace;
and as a result of inattention the Hoosier,
as Eggleston&#8217;s schoolmaster found him, was appearing
on the scene. And yet, in 1837, while
this type was increasing, a member of the legislature
declared, during the discussion of a proposed
school tax, that &#8220;When I die I want my
epitaph written, &#8216;Here lies an enemy to free
schools.&#8217;&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>But while many enemies of common school
education were blocking the way, an unheralded
champion was to appear, whose identity was not
generally known for several years after he took
the field, and whose services entitle him to first
place among all who have striven for the advancement
of learning in Indiana. This was
Caleb Mills, a native of New Hampshire (1806)
and a graduate of Dartmouth (1828) and of
Andover Theological Seminary (1833). In
1831 he had made a tour of the Southwest in
the interest of Sunday-schools, and the social
and intellectual conditions that he found had
deeply impressed him. It was a kind providence
that led him back to Indiana in 1833, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
that gave to his adopted State the benefit of his
sympathy, intelligence, and spirit to the end of
his life. Among his classmates at Dartmouth
were Milo Parker Jewett, who helped to mould
the common school system of Ohio, and later
became the first president of Vassar College,
and Edmund O. Hovey, associated with Mills
as a founder of Wabash College, and long a
member of its faculty. Others of his Indiana
contemporaries may have appreciated the gravity
of the situation as fully as he, but it was left
for Mills to sound the alarm and lead the charge.
In the first year after he entered the State it
was averred by a reputable witness that &#8220;only
about one child in eight between five and fifteen
years is able to read.&#8221; Dr. Joseph F. Tuttle,
the honored president of Wabash College for
nearly a third of a century, described the condition
of affairs in these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;In 1840 there were 273,784 children in the State of
school age, of whom only 48,180 attended the common
schools. One-seventh of the adult population could not
read, and a large proportion of those who could read did
so imperfectly. In spite of the constitutional provision of
the State and the famous &#8216;sixteenth section,&#8217; the common
schools of Indiana were in bad condition. As late as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
1846 the State rated lowest among the free States as to
its popular intelligence and means of popular education.
Even the capital of the State did not have a free school
until 1853, and then one was kept open only two months.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The census of 1840 showed the illiteracy of
Indiana to be 14.32 per cent. The return
made by Illinois at this time was but little
better, while Ohio, on the eastern boundary,
showed only 5.54 per cent of illiterates. Omitting
Illinois and Indiana, the illiteracy of the
Northern States was only one in forty; in Illinois
and Indiana it was one in seven. In
twenty-two counties of Indiana the average
illiteracy was more than 26.5 per cent. Montgomery
County, the home of Wabash College,
returned at this time one-fifth of her adult
population as illiterate, and Putnam County,
the seat of Asbury College, returned one-sixth
of her adult population as belonging to the
same class.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>With a knowledge of these facts Mills made
and published, in the winter of 1846, &#8220;An
Address to the Legislature of Indiana,&#8221; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
signed it &#8220;One of the People.&#8221; The motto
of this, as of his five succeeding addresses,
was, &#8220;Read, discuss, and circulate.&#8221; These
were all written in a tone well calculated to
interest and arouse. He handled his statistics
skilfully, and made clear the alarming progress
of illiteracy in the State. He was as
ready with suggestions as with criticisms, and
his several papers show him to have been
thoroughly informed as to the educational
conditions existing in every part of the country.
He possessed great patience, and the
series of pamphlets was marked throughout
by good temper. He wrote in a deliberate
manner, rarely showing haste or anxiety, as
if confident of the impression that would be
created by fair and judicial statement, and
with faith in the ultimate triumph of his
cause.</p>

<p>In the year following the publication of
his first address, a call was issued for a
general meeting of educators to be held at
Indianapolis. Among those interested in the
movement were Ovid Butler, afterward the
generous benefactor of Butler College, Henry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
Ward Beecher, pastor of the Second Presbyterian
Church of Indianapolis, and John
Coburn. A series of common school conventions
followed, and was of great value in
unifying sentiment. In the roll of those who
were prominent in the first meeting appeared
the names of Isaac Blackford, Oliver H.
Smith, Calvin Fletcher, Jeremiah Sullivan,
Richard W. Thompson, Solomon Meredith,
and James Blake, who were of the saving
remnant of their time. As a result of the
agitation by Mills, the conventions of educators,
and the ceaseless activity of many friends of
education, the legislature of 1847-1848 authorized
the people to express their sentiments for
or against a tax for the support of free schools,
at the election to be held in the fall of 1848.
This was a presidential year, and the Mexican
War issues were discussed bitterly in Indiana
and in the border States, where slavery
lifted its head ominously; but the advocates
of free schools forced their issue and evoked
from the enemy a variety of objections which
strike the sense curiously in these later years.
Should the industrious be taxed to support the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
indolent? Should the people be made benevolent
by law? There was priestcraft in the
scheme; free schools were merely a bait; the
real object was the union of Church and State.
Free schools would make education too common,
said some; but the fiercest antagonism
came from the class for whom the friends of
free schools were laboring&mdash;the wretchedly
poor and ignorant.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The vote on the school
question was 13,000 less than the vote for
president cast the same day, but free schools
won, the affirmative vote being 78,523; the
negative 61,887&mdash;a majority of 16,636 for
free schools. The principal opposition to free
schools was manifested in the counties lying
south of a line drawn across the map along
the southern boundary of Marion County, in
which Indianapolis is situated. The northern
counties gave a majority of 18,270 for free
schools; while the southern division, deriving
its population chiefly from the South, gave a
majority of 1634 against the proposition. Professor
Boone has pointed out that &#8220;notwithstanding
the denser population having the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
older settlements, the established industries,
and all of the colleges but one, the most insistent
opposition to free schools came from
the southern half of the State. The influence
of local seminaries and colleges seems to have
gone for nothing in the movement for free
elementary schools.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mills returned imperturbably to the attack
in a third message carefully scrutinizing this
vote, and showing that of the thirty-one counties
voting negatively, twenty were below the
general average of intelligence. The same
measure and tolerance that characterized all
his addresses show finely in this paper, in
which he said: &#8220;Let the record of the affirmative
vote stand as a proof of the existence
in our State of the spirit of &#8217;76. I rejoice
that we have such indubitable evidence of it.
I rejoice that we have been furnished with
such proof that we are not the degenerate
sons of noble fathers, but that we possess the
spirit to rebuke selfishness wherever found,
and however disguised&mdash;a kindred spirit to
that which pledged life and fortune and sacred
honor to the cause of national independence.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>A new school law was framed by the legislature
in 1848-1849, which legalized public
taxation for schools and changed the existing
system of school administration; but the respective
counties were to be free to adopt or
reject the law as they might see fit, and it
was only a <i>via media</i>, beyond which lay still
much ground for the friends of education to
conquer. At an election held in August, 1849,
the counties exercised their privilege to pass
on the new law. Friends and foes of free
schools again conducted a heated campaign,
both sides amplifying the arguments advanced
in the former contest. The result was a majority
in favor of the law of 15,767, a decrease
from the majority given in the preceding
election, though the two results may not fairly
be compared, owing to local issues and animosities.
Fifty-nine counties voted for the
law and thirty-one against it, and of those
that rejected it twenty were in the southern
half of the State. But the battle was more
nearly won than the friends of education
imagined. The constitutional convention that
met in 1850 prescribed in the organic law of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
Indiana a foundation which subsequent legislatures
have built upon until a comprehensive
system of schools, intelligently administered
and adequately supported, is now the pride of
the State.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The friends of education were to
meet with further trials and discouragements;
but the pioneer work in Indiana education
closed when the new constitution had been
ratified by the people. It is clear that any
examination of the forces that raised Indiana
into an enlightened community must comprehend
a knowledge of these early struggles,
and that the showier attainments of later citizens
cannot obscure for the sincere student
the services of those who dared to stand for
the cause of free schools in the day of their
peril.</p>

<p>Mills is an especially admirable and winning
figure. He was hardly equalled for sagacity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
and suavity among his contemporaries, and he
brought to bear upon his great task a steadfastness
and quiet energy that no defeat could
overcome. The State recognized his abilities
and rewarded his services by confiding to him
the office of State superintendent of public
instruction, of which he was the second incumbent.
He was deeply though sanely patriotic,
and during the Civil War his zeal for the
Union cause was so marked that one of his
associates pronounced him the best recruiting
officer in Indiana. He belonged to Wabash
College, and continued in its faculty until the
end of his long life (October 17, 1879), giving
his last years, with characteristic unselfishness
and devotion, to the organization of the
college library.</p>

<p>The early Hoosier school-teachers were often
poorly trained, and sometimes were adventurers
from England, Scotland, or Ireland. Occasionally
they were intemperate, and frequently they
were eccentric characters, whose vagaries made
them ridiculous before their pupils; but there
were competent instructors among them. One
of the most charming figures in the history of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
cultivation in Indiana is Mrs. Julia L. Dumont
(1794-1857), who was born in Ohio, but for
forty-three years resided at Vevay, in Switzerland
County. Among all the light-bringers
of the first half of the century in the Hoosier
country Mrs. Dumont was one of the most
distinguished; and she was easily the woman
of most varied accomplishment in the Indiana
of her day. She possessed an instinct for
teaching, and Dr. Eggleston remembers that
after she was sixty a schoolroom was built for
her beside her husband&#8217;s house, and that she
taught the Vevay High School in her old age,
when no properly qualified teacher appeared
to take charge of it. Dr. Eggleston draws her
portrait from memory:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;I can see the wonderful old lady now, as she was then,
with her cape pinned awry, rocking her splint-bottom
chair nervously while she talked, full of all manner of
knowledge; gifted with something very like eloquence in
speech, abounding in affection for her pupils and enthusiasm
in teaching, she moved us strangely. Being infatuated
with her we became fanatic in our pursuit of knowledge,
so that the school hours were not enough, and we had
a &#8216;lyceum&#8217; in the evening for reading &#8216;compositions&#8217;
and a club for the study of history. If a recitation became
very interesting, the entire school would sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
be drawn into the discussion of the subject; all other
lessons went to the wall; books of reference were brought
out of her library; hours were consumed, and many a time
the school session was prolonged until darkness forced
us reluctantly to adjourn. Mrs. Dumont was the ideal of
a teacher because she succeeded in forming character.
She gave her pupils unstinted praise, not hypocritically,
but because she lovingly saw the best in every one. We
worked in the sunshine. A dull but industrious pupil
was praised for diligence, a bright pupil for ability, a good
one for general excellence. The dullards got more than
their share, for, knowing how easily such an one is disheartened,
Mrs. Dumont went out of her way to praise
the first show of success in a slow scholar. She treated
no two alike. She was full of all sorts of knack and tact,
a person of infinite resource for calling out the human
spirit.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Her natural grace and refinement gave to her
discipline many a novel turn. She endeavored,
and most happily succeeded in the attempt, to
link the life of the time and place to &#8220;high
thought and honorable deeds.&#8221; Once, during
her administration of the Vevay High School,
a game of ball proved so absorbing that the
boys were an hour late in reporting after the
noon recess. They found the teacher calmly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
enthroned in her rocking-chair. She did not
ask for an explanation, but spoke to them firmly
of their indifference; they had humiliated her,
she said, before the whole town. No recesses
would be allowed for a week, and an apology
must be forthcoming the following day.
The apology was duly submitted in writing.
The remainder of the incident is best described
in Dr. Eggleston&#8217;s own words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The morning wore on without recess. The lessons were
heard as usual. As the noon hour drew near, Mrs. Dumont
rose from her chair and went into the library. We
all felt that something was going to happen. She came
out with a copy of Shakespeare, which she opened at
about the fifth scene of the fourth act of the second part
of King Henry IV. Giving the book to my next neighbor
and myself, she bade us read the scene, alternating with
the change of the speaker. You remember the famous
dialogue in the scene between the dying king and the
prince who has prematurely taken the crown from the bedside
of the sleeping king. It was all wonderfully fresh to
us and to our schoolmates, whose interest was divided between
the scene and a curiosity as to the use the teacher
meant to make of it. At length the reader who took the
king&#8217;s part read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent13">&#8220;&#8216;O, my son!</div>
<div class="verse">Heaven put it in thy mind to take it hence,</div>
<div class="verse">That thou mightst win the more thy father&#8217;s love,</div>
<div class="verse">Pleading so wisely in excuse of it.&#8217;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>Then she took the book and closed it. The application
was evident to all, but she made us a touching little speech,
full of affection, and afterward restored the recess.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Dumont was the first Hoosier to become
known beyond the State through imaginative
writing. In the little school of story-tellers and
poets that flourished in the Ohio Valley in its
early history, she was one of the chief figures.
It had not then become the fashion to transcribe
with fidelity our American local life, and her
prose sketches usually reflected nothing of the
pioneer times. Her &#8220;Life Sketches from Common
Paths: A Series of American Tales,&#8221; published
at New York in 1856, is in the best
manner of the day. Western is italicized in the
preface of &#8220;Ashton Gray,&#8221; the novelette which
closes the volume, and the author evidently believed
that she was making a record of the life
that lay about her; but after all, the scene is
laid in Ohio and not in Indiana, and a Western
atmosphere is not discernible. The hero is
the traditional hero of old romance, &#8220;whose
innate delicacy was refinement, and whose
generous impulses, chivalry,&#8221; and whose &#8220;extreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
beauty&#8221; was a subject of comment from
fair lips. It is not surprising that Annabel,
&#8220;the dreamy, the impressible, the desolate
Annabel,&#8221; should have found Ashton &#8220;her
beau-ideal of the distinctive characteristics of
the fearless and self-sustained backwoodsman....
The untamed horse that tosses his mane
in the green savannas could scarcely have
moved with more freedom; and the perfect
development of limb and muscle evidently
arose from the conscious vigor and habitual
action of one accustomed to tread, not the gay
saloon and prescribed walks of fashion, but
the rough paths of danger, and the limitless
range of voiceless solitudes.&#8221; Ashton rescues
three children from a burning cabin, using a
ladder, in keeping with the best traditions,
thus winning the heart of Annabel, who marries
him clandestinely, just before he is arrested
for murder. He is acquitted by the testimony
of his supposed father, and an old Indian appears
opportunely to confess that Ashton was
really the son of Colonel Ainsworth, Annabel&#8217;s
guardian.</p>

<p>There was a particular vocabulary that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
belonged to this school of romance, and Mrs.
Dumont employed it in all its copiousness.
When rightly used it minimized the importance
of invention; and it was better adapted
to the portrayal of delicate and shrinking heroines
and noble and handsome heroes, than to
the rougher work of depicting action. A nice
instinct was essential to its proper use, and
no one of her generation wielded it with more
grace and ease than Mrs. Dumont. Scott and
Irving were the inspiration of the school in
which she took so high a place; and the verse
which it produced so abundantly showed frequently
the influence of Mrs. Hemans. Mrs.
Dumont&#8217;s technical skill was superior to that
of her Western contemporaries; but it is idle
and ungracious to criticise the writings of one
whose talents were so varied, and whose life
was consecrated to good works.</p>

<p>Her name inevitably suggests that of another
teacher, her kinswoman, Miss Catharine
Merrill (1824-1900), who, with a wider field
and larger opportunity, filled a similar place
at Indianapolis for fifty years. She was born
at Corydon, the old capital. Samuel Merrill,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
her father, was a cultivated man, a native of
Vermont, and an early settler of Indianapolis.
He subscribed to the English reviews and
owned a large library, whose contents circulated
freely among the pioneers. He had
been educated at Dartmouth, and occasionally
taught the higher branches, but he was
a man of affairs, served the public in important
offices, and was one of the ablest of the
State&#8217;s early financiers. The daughter taught
English literature in Butler College for eighteen
years, and during this time, and subsequently
as a teacher of private classes, inculcated in
the minds of three generations a discriminating
taste for literature. Miss Merrill wrote (1869)
&#8220;The Soldier of Indiana,&#8221; a valuable record
of the State&#8217;s participation in the war of the
rebellion, which contains much biographical
matter that is nowhere else collected. Mrs.
Dumont and Miss Merrill afford delightful
illustrations of the compelling force of personality.
In a sense one succeeded the other,
and, though they labored in different fields,
throughout a century they impressed upon
the youth of the commonwealth the nobility<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
of character and the love of learning which
they so happily combined in themselves.</p>

<p>Samuel K. Hoshour is another sterling figure
in Indiana pedagogy. He was a native
of Pennsylvania, and a minister, first in the
Lutheran and afterward in the Disciples
Church; but he was a school-teacher first,
last, and always, and taught many hundreds
of the youth of Indiana. He was, in his later
years, a resident of Indianapolis, and died there
in 1883. Oliver P. Morton, Lew Wallace, and
others of the distinguished men of the State sat
under his teaching. In the eyes of two generations
he was the embodiment of learning and
scholarship; and he retained to the last something
of the austerity and exaggerated dignity
of the old-fashioned school-teacher. He was,
indeed, always the schoolmaster, and a pedant,
though na&iuml;vely seeking to avoid the appearance
of it. He was a linguist of wide reputation,
and delighted in comparative philology.
He had a fancy for unusual words, and
took pleasure in illuminating their meanings
from obscure origins. He wrote a book, prized
by many of his old pupils, called &#8220;Altisonant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
Letters&#8221; (1840), which, as the title indicates,
was written in high-sounding words. It is in
the form of correspondence, and was devised
as a kind of philological primer, to be &#8220;a
stepping-stone from the current everyday
English to the Latin and Greek.&#8221; The plan
was not a bad one, and was in some respects
a forerunner of the inductive methods of teaching
languages that have since been popular.</p>

<small>AN EXPERIMENT IN SOCIALISM</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">New Harmony</span>, the scene of Robert Owen&#8217;s
experiment in socialism, lies in Posey County,
in the far southwestern corner of Indiana.
The village is without direct communication
with the outer world, but may be approached
by boat on the Wabash River, or by a branch
railroad which ends abruptly at New Harmony
after a rough course through wheat fields,
which are, in spring and summer, a charming
feature of the landscape of this region. George
Rapp gave expression to his peculiar religious
ideas in the community which he established
there, and he sold his large estate to Owen,
who began building on the foundations left
by Rapp a social structure after plans of his
own. Owen&#8217;s ideas are not strikingly novel
when taken in connection with the history of
socialism; but the movement carried to Indiana
many distinguished persons, and the life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
of subsequent generations in and about the
village has, to this day, been colored by it.</p>

<p>George Rapp came to the United States
from Germany, in 1803, in search of a more
tolerant home for the sect which he had
founded. He purchased a tract of land in
Butler County, Pennsylvania, and during the
summer of 1804 six hundred of his followers,
chiefly mechanics and laborers, joined him,
and in the following year the community known
as the Harmony Society was formally organized.
The members were banded together in
a Christian brotherhood, and were orthodox
in all essentials. Property was held in common,
and thought was directed away from
mundane affairs to the second coming of the
Lord, which Rapp believed to be imminent.
The members experienced, in 1807, a great
spiritual awakening, and one of its results was
their acceptance of celibacy as an implied if
not obligatory tenet of the sect.</p>

<p>In 1814, the community sold the greater
part of its holdings of real estate in Pennsylvania
and purchased 30,000 acres of land in
Indiana, of which Harmony became the centre.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
The following year the Rappites moved to the
lower Wabash and continued in a new wilderness
their severe labors and ascetic practices.
They marked out a village in squares,
with broad streets, and built houses in which
beauty was sacrificed to stability. It is a tribute
to their excellent workmanship that many
of these structures are still in use, having
survived two communistic experiments and
falling at last to the incidental needs of
a Western village. The Rappites had been
annoyed during their sojourn in Pennsylvania
by unsympathetic neighbors, and fearing similar
experiences with the rough characters
that roamed the Wabash country in those
days, they deemed it wise to prepare a defence.
They thereupon built, of brick and
stone, a substantial fortress which was used as
a granary. The walls were three feet thick
and the loopholes were barred. The story
that this building was connected with Rapp&#8217;s
house by an underground passage is authoritatively
denied at New Harmony.</p>

<p>The Rappites had first used a frame building
as a place of worship, but later they erected a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
large brick meeting-house, carving on the pediment
above the main door a wreath and a rose,
the date, 1822, and the inscription, &#8220;Mich IV,
8; in Memory of the Harmony Society; by
George Rapp, 1805.&#8221; The colonists were industrious
and thrifty. They cleared the land,
planted vineyards, manufactured woollen and
cotton goods and shoes, and found a ready
market for all their products. The original
population of the Pennsylvania settlement had
been about six hundred persons; and during
the community&#8217;s life in Indiana accessions of
friends from Germany increased the number
of members to between seven and eight hundred.
In 1824 Rapp again decided to move,
and appointed Richard Flower to negotiate a
sale. Flower visited Scotland, sought Robert
Owen, a manufacturer and social reformer,
and sold him the Rappites&#8217; land for $132,000.
Subsequently there was an additional sale of
live-stock, tools, and merchandise for $50,000,
so that the total of Owen&#8217;s original investment
at New Harmony was $182,000. The Rappites
thereupon disappeared from Indiana,
returning to Pennsylvania, where they established<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
a new settlement called Economy, and
prospered greatly.</p>

<p>Robert Owen was born in Wales, March 14,
1771. His father was a saddler, and Robert
began his career under no favoring circumstances.
He became interested in cotton spinning,
for which he showed genius and at which
he made a fortune. He married the daughter
of David Dale, the owner of extensive cotton
mills at New Lanark, on the Clyde, became
Dale&#8217;s successor, and with growing fortune
gave an increasing attention to social and
political questions. He was a pioneer in the
reform of factory abuses; and in his own
establishment at New Lanark he made practical
application of his theories. He visited
the Continent, where he became acquainted
with many persons of note, not the least of
these being Pestalozzi and Fellenberg; he was
much in London, usually in advocacy of some
reform; he acquired skill in writing and speaking,
and taken altogether his biography gives
the impression of a strong, zealous, and indefatigable
nature. He was intense and uncompromising,
and, it must be confessed, sadly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
lacking in humor. He expected to find in
the new world larger opportunities for the
demonstration of his principles. The New
Harmony incident illustrates a curious conflict
between the ideal and the practical in Owen.
It was quite like him to undertake the planting
of a communistic settlement in America, and
to invest his own money in it; but a natural
business caution checked his generous impulses,
and while he extended a sweeping invitation to
the industrious and well-disposed of all creeds
to join him, he was in no haste to divide his
property.</p>

<p>Owen&#8217;s lectures in the hall of the House of
Representatives at Washington, February 5
and March 27, 1825, before audiences composed
of the famous men of the day, gave
wide publicity to his views. He displayed a
model of the ideal village which he proposed
to found on the Wabash. The community
buildings were to form a hollow square 1000
feet long. The material needs of his proposed
colony were all provided for in the buildings
of his model village; and he announced a
comprehensive system of education in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
the young of the community should be led
from the lowest to the highest branches.
Owen had announced that &#8220;these new proceedings,&#8221;
as he called his plans, were to take
effect at New Harmony&mdash;he gave the prefix
to Rapp&#8217;s name for the place&mdash;in April,
1826. He spent the summer of 1825 in
England, but returned to America in the fall,
reaching New York November 7. His hospitable
invitation had awakened the interest
of a large number of persons, ranging from
sincere converts to eccentric and irresponsible
vagabonds, drawn from all parts of the United
States and Europe. What is known in New
Harmony literature as &#8220;the boat load of
knowledge&#8221; set out from Pittsburg in December,
1825. About thirty people assembled
on a keel boat, which they made comfortable
for the voyage, and turned toward New Harmony.
The ice closed upon them near
Beaver, and they did not reach their destination
until the middle of January. The
passengers included Robert Owen and his
sons, Robert Dale and William, William
Maclure, Thomas Say, Charles A. Lesueur,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
Achilles Fretageot and wife, Captain Donald
Macdonald, Dr. Gerard Troost, Phiquepal
d&#8217;Arusmont, and Stedman Whitwell, a
London architect.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Joseph Neef followed in
the spring, and Frances Wright, of Nashoba
fame, who married d&#8217;Arusmont, first appeared
there in the second year of the community.
Schoolcraft and Rafinesque were both visitors
at New Harmony, but not during the life
of the Owen community, though Rafinesque
has been erroneously named as an original
member.</p>

<p>The strength of the keel boat&#8217;s contribution
to the community lay in special scientific
knowledge; and if Owen&#8217;s inclination toward
socialism had been increased by the success
of Rapp&#8217;s submissive peasants, he erred gravely
in his own choice of followers. William Maclure
(1763-1840) was a wealthy Scotchman, who
turned from a successful mercantile career to
the natural sciences. He first visited the
United States in the last years of the eighteenth
century, and planned a geographical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
survey of the whole country. He explored
at his own expense a vast territory, and prepared
maps showing the result of his investigations.
He was a founder of the Academy
of Natural Sciences, at Philadelphia, to which
he gave generously of his fortune, and was its
president for more than twenty years. His
friend, Thomas Say (1787-1834), called &#8220;the
father of American zo&ouml;logy,&#8221; was also connected
with the Academy in its formative
years. The place of both is secure in the
history of American science. Lesueur came to
the United States from the West Indies. His
scientific researches had included extensive investigations
in Australia, and he was an early,
if not indeed the first, student of the Mound-builders&#8217;
remains in Indiana. He was an artist
of considerable merit, and some of his work
may be seen in the New Harmony library.
Troost (1776-1850) was a scientist of wide and
exact knowledge, who went to Tennessee after
the collapse of New Harmony, taught the
sciences for many years in the University of
Nashville, and was for eighteen years State
geologist. Neef was a native of Alsace. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
had been a teacher in Pestalozzi&#8217;s school, in
Switzerland, and met there his wife, who was
educated under the direction of Madame Pestalozzi.
They removed to Philadelphia immediately
after their marriage, and became acquainted
with Maclure, who, like Owen, had been attracted
by the Pestalozzi system, and who
persuaded them to join the Owenites. Little
is known of Macdonald, though there is a
tradition at New Harmony that he returned to
Scotland and inherited a title of nobility.</p>

<p>Owen&#8217;s followers moved into the houses
that had been vacated by Rapp&#8217;s colonists,
and set about organizing the new community.
On April 27 Owen addressed them in the Rappite
church, which had been pre&euml;mpted for sectarian
uses and dedicated to liberal thought
and free speech. He spoke with great enthusiasm,
declaring that he had come to introduce
a new and enlightened state of society, eliminate
ignorance and selfishness, and remove all
cause for contest between individuals; but the
change from the new to the old could not be
accomplished in a day, and he called New
Harmony a halfway house between the evils<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
he complained of and the ideal. In May, the
<i>modus vivendi</i> of a preliminary society was
promulgated, as a means of preparation for
the perfect community to which Owen looked
forward. Negroes were excluded from membership,
though they might become &#8220;helpers,&#8221;
or they might form an independent community.
Age and experience alone were to confer precedence.
For the first year a committee to be
appointed by the founder was to have charge
of affairs, and later the society might elect
three representatives of this council. Members
were required to provide their own household
effects, to accept houses assigned to them, and
to render their best services to the community.
They were to receive credit at the community
store for their labor, which was to be appraised
by the committee of management. Members
might be expelled for cause, or they might
voluntarily retire by giving a week&#8217;s notice,
receiving in merchandise any balance that
remained to their credit. Persons wishing to
live in the community as non-participants in
its labors might do so by paying for the
privilege, and the capital of any who cared to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
become investors would be received. American
products were to have the preference in the
purchase of supplies. The young were to be
drilled in military tactics, to the end that they
might be of service to their country in emergencies,
until society had been reformed and war
made unnecessary.</p>

<p>Within six months nearly one thousand persons
had gathered at New Harmony, and a
considerable proportion of these seem to have
been incapable, either through inexperience
or disinclination, of aiding in the success of
Owen&#8217;s plans. Rapp&#8217;s industries had certainly
not fallen into the hands of skilled or
adaptable laborers. Many of the manufactories
which he had made profitable were not operated
under the new r&eacute;gime, and less than a
hundred farm laborers volunteered for service
in carrying on the plantations. Plans for education
and social pleasure were received more
kindly than those requiring skilled labor. All
children between two and twelve were placed
in a separate house, and clothed, lodged, and
educated at the public expense. The fall of
1825 found 130 children so cared for, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
there were also day and evening schools where
old and young alike might receive elementary
instruction. A band was organized to provide
music, and Tuesday evenings were set apart
for balls and Friday evenings for concerts.
Wednesday evenings were reserved for the
more serious business of discussing the purposes
of the society. Military exercises, as
proposed by Owen, were duly conducted, and
companies of artillery and infantry were formed
and drilled.</p>

<p>The senior Owen was absent in Scotland
during the summer and fall of 1825, but returned
January 18, 1826, and was received
with great cordiality. He expressed his satisfaction
with the progress that had been made
during his absence, and in a few days announced
that he felt justified in suspending the preparatory
stage and inaugurating full equality.
A new constitution was adopted February 5,
after careful consideration in town meetings.
It provided for community of property and
business and social co&ouml;peration. The members
were to dwell together as one family,
and no discrimination was to be shown on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
account of occupation. Similar houses were
to be provided for all, and no differences in
food or clothing were to be permitted. The
community was to be divided into departments
of Agriculture, Manufactures and Mechanics,
Literature and Science, Domestic and General
Economy, Education and Commerce. Superintendents
for these departments were to be
chosen by an assembly consisting of all adult
members of the community; but the individuals
in the several departments might select
their own foremen. A schism occurred before
this constitution had been signed by the members
of the preliminary society. The exact
cause is not assigned in the <i>Gazette</i>, the official
organ of the society, conducted by Robert
Dale Owen, which announced, February 15,
that a new community was about to be formed
within two miles of the village &#8220;by some respectable
families who were members of the
preliminary society, but from conscientious
motives have declined signing the new constitution.&#8221;
Two new communities were, indeed,
organized, one called Macluria and the
other Feiba Peveli. This latter name was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
coined after an intricate system of geographical
nomenclature, invented by a member of the
society, by which the latitude and longitude of
any place could be represented. The sole direction
of the community was intrusted to
Robert Owen two weeks after the reorganization,
the inference from this fact being that the
separation of the two branches had eliminated
those who were antagonistic to the founder.
At the end of the first year the population
was distributed about as follows: the original
New Harmony settlement, 800; Macluria, 120;
Feiba Peveli, 60 or 70. The relations between
Owen and the seceders were apparently
friendly. In an address delivered at New
Harmony, May 9, he spoke with satisfaction
of the success of his undertaking, saying that
his hopes had been surpassed, and mentioning
both Macluria and Feiba Peveli with approval.
At Macluria temporary cabins had
been built and more land had been cultivated
than was necessary to sustain the members.
Spinning and weaving were practised by the
women and children, who produced cloth in
excess of their requirements. Feiba Peveli was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
a farming and gardening community, reported
by Owen to be doing well.</p>

<p>At this time the first Rappite church was
given up to carpentry and shoemaking. Boys
received industrial training there and slept in
the loft. The second and more pretentious
edifice had become a town hall, used for
lectures, open discussions, dances, and concerts.
Rapp&#8217;s former home&mdash;the best residence in
the place&mdash;was occupied by Maclure, who had
given $45,000 to assist Owen in his enterprise.
Owen lived at the tavern, which was conducted
by the society. The rank and file were accommodated
in four boarding-houses pending
changes that would bring all together at a common
table. A uniform dress for the members
had been adopted, but it was not generally
worn. Wide trousers, buttoned over a short
collarless jacket, were prescribed for the men;
the women wore a coat reaching to the knee,
and pantalettes. Bernard, Duke of Saxe-Weimar,
who visited New Harmony in the spring
of 1826, and wrote a most entertaining account
of the community, described the costume and
remarked that the members who had already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
donned it were of the higher social class,
and that these did not, in the gatherings at
the public hall, mingle with the ruder element.
Previous conditions and employments were evidently
remembered in the community, in spite
of the founder&#8217;s insistence that there should
be no discrimination. Many in the settlement
found the practical details of community life
exceedingly irksome; and one, a Russian lady,
confided to the German nobleman her disgust
with New Harmony, stating that &#8220;some of
the society were too low, and the table was below
all criticism.&#8221;</p>

<p>The educational features of the community
were, from all testimony, a great failure and
disappointment. It was one thing to assemble
distinguished scientists, and quite another to
organize them into an effective teaching corps.
The school taught by d&#8217;Arusmont lasted but
a short time, and Robert Dale Owen, who
was himself a teacher in one of the community
schools, while admitting the man&#8217;s good
qualities, described him as &#8220;a wrong-headed
genius, whose extravagance and wilfulness and
inordinate self-conceit destroyed his usefulness.&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
Neef had been an officer under
Napoleon, and his rough military habits had
not been wholly corrected by his subsequent
association with Pestalozzi. The Duke of Saxe-Weimar
gives a lively picture of him, drilling
his boy pupils in military tactics as he led
them to the performance of certain labors in
the village. Maclure, Say, and Troost did
not engage actively in teaching. Paul Brown
stated, in a pamphlet assailing the society,
that he began teaching in the boarding-school
in September, 1826; but from his own story
Brown was chiefly employed with meditations
on the evils of the place, and his manifestations
of temper argue against his value as
a teacher. Madame Fretageot was associated
with Neef, and the two had charge of the
boarding-school. Madame Neef was not regularly
employed as a teacher, but sometimes
assisted her husband.</p>

<p>Robert Owen&#8217;s unfriendly attitude toward
religion had awakened hostility in England
before he came to the United States. Packard,
one of his biographers, expresses no doubt as
to Owen&#8217;s disbelief in the inspiration of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
Bible and in the divine origin of Christianity.
Lloyd Jones, the writer of another life of Owen,
seeks to mitigate the effect of some of the statements
in Owen&#8217;s &#8220;New Moral World&#8221;; but it
is sufficiently clear that when he was at the
height of his fame and usefulness in England,
Owen estranged many of his most influential
friends and admirers by his flings at religion,
which were serious enough to arouse the wrath
of an occasional heresy-hunting bishop. Sargent,
the author of &#8220;Robert Owen and his Philosophy,&#8221;
says that Owen suffered for his religious
opinions &#8220;neglect, hatred, contempt, calumny,
and all the evils that follow the excommunicated
man.&#8221; In his &#8220;Declaration of Mental
Independence&#8221; at New Harmony, July 4, 1826,
Owen inveighed against &#8220;a trinity of the most
monstrous evils that could be combined to inflict
mental and physical evil upon the whole race.
I refer to private or individual property, absurd
and irrational systems of religion, and marriage
founded on individual property combined with
some of these irrational systems of religion&#8221;&mdash;a
statement that was somewhat advanced
for the Wabash Valley of that period. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
seemed to ignore the spiritual element in man,
though, according to Sargent, he expressed in
his old age his belief that a Divine Providence
had guided him through his long career; and
late in life he became a convert to spiritualism.
There is no evidence that Owen ever held loose
ideas of the relations of the sexes, though such
opinions were attributed to him. He believed
that marriage should be founded on mutual
sympathy and congeniality, and he wished the
imagination to be excluded and judgment made
the sole guide in such matters. This, like many
of his teachings, seems equivocal; but he believed
that where these prerequisites ceased to
exist it should be possible to terminate a marriage.
Owen and Maclure both believed fully
in the equality of the sexes. New Harmony
schools were co-educational, and women were
admitted to all the councils of the society. It
is not clear that they were always permitted to
vote, though widows succeeded to the suffrages
of their husbands. A woman&#8217;s society was organized,
and is supposed to have been similar
to literary clubs as now known, though there
is but one reference to the organization in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
the <i>Gazette</i>&mdash;a notice of the postponement
of a meeting in November, 1825.</p>

<p>Owen&#8217;s refusal to make a formal transfer
of his property to the community continued
to be a cause of dissatisfaction. The founder
spoke hopefully of the future, but he took care
that his enthusiasm should not run away with
his judgment, so he continued to hold his little
principality in fee simple. When questioned as
to his intentions in this particular, he replied, as
officially reported in the <i>Gazette</i> of August 30,
1826: &#8220;I shall be ready to form such a community
whenever you are ready for it....
But progress must be made in community education
before all parties can be prepared for
a community of common property.&#8221; The assembly
thereupon adopted a resolution that
they meet three evenings in the week for community
education, but this was evidently regarded
by the members as a severe penalty to
pay for the cause of socialism. Robert Dale
Owen wrote that the meetings continued &#8220;with
gradually lessening numbers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Troubles came thick and fast in the fall
of 1826. Several adventurers openly tried to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
defraud Owen, and an era of suspicion began.
A man named Taylor joined the community,
at Owen&#8217;s invitation, to take charge of the industries,
but after getting possession of a tract
of land he started a distillery, greatly to the
founder&#8217;s annoyance. Brown describes with
great particularity the unhappy condition that
prevailed during the fall and winter of 1826.
He complains that Owen was living in luxury
at the tavern, while the laborers in the large
boarding-houses fared badly. Although there
were several professional gardeners in the community,
there was a lack of vegetables, and the
necessities were doled out sparingly. Brown
believed that the founder was trying to retrieve
his fortunes, and he speaks of him as &#8220;willing
to shift into the character of a retailer and tavern
keeper.&#8221; The <i>Gazette</i> was, in Brown&#8217;s
belief, the personal organ of Owen, whom he
calls &#8220;the lord proprietor of the press&#8221;; but
this may be merely the wail of the rejected, for
Brown admits that his own contributions were
repeatedly scorned, so that to gain publicity he
was obliged to post them on the gateway of the
educational society, taking them in at night for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
safety. He says that in spite of the balls and
promenade concerts the people remained strangers,
and he deplores the amount of time and
candles wasted in these frivolities. As to the
educational features of the place, Brown expresses
his opinion that there was no other
place in the United States where a like number
of children in the same compass &#8220;were of so
harsh, insolent, rash, boisterous, and barbarous
dispositions.&#8221; Brown deals drastically with the
auditing department of the community. He
intimates that when a debit balance appeared
against a member on the books, credit was
immediately stopped at the store. He gives
the instance of a gardener named Gilbert, who
was suddenly served with his discharge in December,
when his family were ill, because he
was performing no labor and had fallen in
arrears. Gilbert asked for an investigation,
which was held, and the court found in his
favor.</p>

<p>Twenty heads of families were notified to
quit February 1, 1827; March 21 there was an
exodus of about eighty persons, who took a
steamboat for the upper Ohio, and March 28<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
the <i>Gazette</i> contained an editorial admitting
the failure of New Harmony, the central community,
but maintaining that the auxiliary societies
were successful. The reason assigned for
the collapse was that &#8220;the members were too
various in their feelings, and too dissimilar in
their habits, to govern themselves harmoniously
as one community.&#8221; Owen delivered a farewell
address to the citizens, May 26. He spoke with
patient forbearance of the element that had
joined the community merely to become a burden
upon him; but he was severe upon his associates
who had undertaken the educational work of the
society but had failed to organize such schools
as he had expected. He had wished the children
to be &#8220;educated in similar habits, dispositions,
and feelings, and be brought up truly as
members of one large family, without a single
discordant feeling.&#8221; If the schools had not
proved ineffectual, he believed that even with
the heterogeneous mass that had collected on
his lands a successful society could have been
founded. However, turning from these unpleasant
reflections, with characteristic optimism,
he declared that &#8220;the social system is now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
firmly established; the natural and easy means
of forming communities have been developed
by your past experience.... New Harmony
is now, therefore, literally surrounded by independent
communities, and applications are made
almost daily by persons who come from far and
near to be permitted to establish themselves in
a similar manner.&#8221; The eight communities
referred to were probably little more than
tentative colonies, planted on Owen&#8217;s lands
under lease. There is no evidence that a
community organization was maintained for
any length of time at Macluria or Feiba Peveli
after the collapse at New Harmony village, and of
the remainder of the eight to which Owen referred
there is no further record. They vanished
with the others, and presently passed to
individual owners or lessees. Brown summarizes
the disappearance of communism and the
return of the old order in these words: &#8220;The
greater part of the town was now resolved into
individual lots; a grocery was established opposite
the tavern; painted sign boards began to
be stuck up on the buildings, pointing out places
of manufacture and trade; a sort of wax figure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
and puppet show was opened at one of the
boarding-houses, charging twenty-five cents for
adults and twelve and a half for children; and
everything went on in the old style.&#8221;</p>

<p>Owen&#8217;s teachings and example led to other
experiments in America besides those he personally
conducted on the Wabash; but American
socialism of the Owen period was most fully
expressed at New Harmony. Owen&#8217;s ardor for
social reforms continued unabated. He visited
Mexico shortly after the New Harmony failure,
to secure a concession of land for further experiments.
The negotiations failed, and he is
next heard of at Cincinnati, in April, 1829, debating
religious questions with Alexander Campbell.
He did not appear in America again
until the fall of 1844, when he spent a short
time on his New Harmony lands, lectured in
many cities, established friendly relations with
Brisbane and other Fourierites, and, in the
spring of 1845, visited Brook Farm. He was
last at New Harmony in the fall of 1846.</p>

<p>It could hardly be expected that a village
which had been the home of two orders of exiles
could descend at once to the commonplace, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
the subsequent history of New Harmony is not
disappointing. Through many years scientists
of distinction and radicals of all degrees visited
the place; Maclure made it his headquarters;
Say lived and died there; the sons of Robert
Owen became residents and gained honorable
distinction in science and politics; books that
still have value were written and published in
the village. Robert Dale Owen (1801-1877)
turned from communism to politics and literature,
and few citizens of Indiana have lived
lives more useful or memorable. He was educated
at Hofwyl, under Fellenberg, and after a
few years of commercial experience at New
Lanark, he joined the New Harmony community.
He shared, in large measure, his father&#8217;s
interests in social and economic matters, and
after the fall of New Harmony he and Frances
Wright conducted a radical paper called the
<i>Free Enquirer</i> at New York. In 1833 he returned
to New Harmony and was soon launched
upon a brilliant career. He was elected a
representative to the Indiana General Assembly
and to the National Congress, and he was
an influential and active member of the convention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
that revised the Indiana constitution.
The Indiana laws granting independent property
rights to women were largely due to his
efforts, and he introduced in Congress, in
December, 1845, the bill under which the
Smithsonian Institute was organized. He was
appointed charg&eacute; d&#8217;affaires at Naples in 1853,
and when the grade of the post was raised he
was continued as minister until 1858. In 1863,
he was chairman of a commission appointed by
the Secretary of War to examine the condition of
the freedmen. He had written to the President,
urging emancipation before this step had been
determined upon, and Secretary Chase said
that Owen&#8217;s letter to Lincoln had greatly influenced
the President to make his proclamation.
Mr. Owen wrote often and well, and with a
facility and force that gave him wide reputation
for learning and literary accomplishment.
His books include &#8220;Pocahontas: A Dream&#8221;
(1837); &#8220;Hints on Architecture&#8221; (1849); &#8220;Footprints
on the Boundary of Another World&#8221;
(1859); &#8220;Beyond the Breakers: A Novel&#8221;
(1870); &#8220;Debatable Land Between this World
and the Next&#8221; (1872); and &#8220;Threading my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
Way&#8221; (1874). He became deeply interested
in spiritualism, and two of his books, as the
titles indicate, are devoted to this subject. He
travelled much and knew many of the men
and women eminent in the early years of the
nineteenth century, including La Fayette and
Mrs. Shelley. His daughter Rosamund married
Laurence Oliphant.</p>

<p>David Dale, another son of Robert (1807-1860),
was educated at Hofwyl and Glasgow,
and reached New Harmony in the year of the
community&#8217;s failure. He was employed by the
Indiana legislature to make a geological survey
of the State, and in 1839 the general government
engaged him to examine Western
mineral lands. He explored Illinois, Iowa, and
Wisconsin under this appointment. Ten years
later he made similar surveys in Minnesota.
During all this time New Harmony was his
home and headquarters, and the rendezvous of
his associates, and his collections of specimens
were assembled there. He was State geologist
of Kentucky from 1854 to 1857, and then turned
to Arkansas, of which he made thorough geological
surveys. In 1859 he was appointed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
State geologist of Indiana, and held the office
until his death. He was a skilled chemist and
a doctor of medicine as well as a trained natural
scientist and geologist. He knew the use of
pencil and brush, and illustrated his reports
with sketches that greatly enhanced their value.</p>

<p>Military talent expressed itself in the Owen
family in Richard, still another of Robert&#8217;s sons
(1810-1890), who was also a graduate of Hofwyl.
He came to America and engaged in business
until the Mexican War, in which he served
as captain, and later assisted his brother, David
Dale, in his surveys of the Northwest. He
taught the natural sciences in the Military Institute
of Kentucky, and when it was merged in
the University of Nashville he continued in the
same capacity with the new institution. Meanwhile
he had, with the energy and ambition
characteristic of his family, earned the degree
of Doctor of Medicine, though he never practised.
He served in the Civil War as colonel
of the Sixtieth Indiana Regiment, principally in
the Southwest, and was once taken prisoner.
After the war he taught in the University of
Indiana for fifteen years, retiring finally to New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
Harmony, where, in the old Rapp mansion, he
continued his studies, writing constantly for the
scientific periodicals. He married a daughter
of Neef. William Owen, who had reached New
Harmony in time to aid his brother, Robert
Dale, in editing the <i>Gazette</i>, continued to live in
Indiana, and became a successful financier.
Descendants of Robert Owen still live at New
Harmony, and the name is one to conjure within
all the lower Wabash Valley.</p>

<p>The excellent work of the New Harmony
press proves that good craftsmanship was
encouraged and appreciated in the early days.
The <i>Gazette</i>, and its successor, the <i>Disseminator</i>,
are models of accurate and tasteful typography,
and the books published from this
isolated village are even more creditable. Say&#8217;s
&#8220;American Conchology&#8221; was wholly printed
at New Harmony, the title page bearing date
1830. Its copious illustrations are the work
of New Harmony lithographers, and the tinting
of the engravings, which was done by
Mrs. Say, reproduces accurately the delicate
shadings of the shells. Her colors are still
fresh and true in copies of this work. Parts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
of Say&#8217;s &#8220;American Entomology,&#8221; which he
had begun at Philadelphia, were finished at
New Harmony. Maclure was an industrious
writer, and the imprint of the New Harmony
press is found in two substantial volumes, one
dated 1831, the other 1837, in which he collected
short essays on innumerable topics.
Josiah Warren was for a time at least the
New Harmony publisher, and Michaux&#8217;s
&#8220;North American Sylva&#8221; was reprinted by
him from plates brought from Paris by Maclure,
though the unbound sheets of the New
Harmony edition were consumed by fire.</p>

<p>Warren was a reformer as well as a publisher.
He was connected with New Harmony for a
short time in community days, but left, returning
in 1842 to establish a &#8220;time store.&#8221; In the
&#8220;time store&#8221; he sold merchandise to none who
could not return the actual cash cost, plus a
profit which must be paid in a &#8220;labor note.&#8221;
This form of currency represented a specified
number of hours of labor, pledged by mechanics
or others. When a customer entered his shop
and began discussing a purchase, Warren
started a clock which marked the amount of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
time consumed in the sale: this was the basis
for computing the merchant&#8217;s profit. Warren
could often be seen in the streets of New Harmony
with large amounts of labor currency.
This medium of exchange required careful
handling, as some would appraise their labor
too high, and now and then depreciation followed
an over-issue by some careless or unscrupulous
individual. Warren conducted this
enterprise for about two years, departing to
carry the gospel of &#8220;equitable commerce,&#8221; as
he called it, elsewhere.</p>

<p>In 1838 the Workingmen&#8217;s Institute and
Library was organized at Maclure&#8217;s suggestion
and with money that he contributed.
Later, Dr. Edward Murphy generously gave
to this association a handsome building, which
contains the library, an art gallery,&mdash;largely
Dr. Murphy&#8217;s gift,&mdash;a hall, and museum. The
building stands in a pretty park and is ideally
adapted to its purposes. The library contains
12,000 volumes, well selected and particularly
rich in scientific works. It includes every available
book relating to American socialism, and
many of the original New Harmony records<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
are preserved there. Dr. Murphy has provided
an endowment for it and for an annual course
of lectures. The lecture course is greatly prized
by the citizens, who have heard under its auspices
many of the learned men of the day. There
was no church in the village for many years;
indeed, with the passing of Rapp little attention
was paid to religious matters at New Harmony
until late in the century, and though there are
Episcopal and Methodist organizations in the
village now, the life of the people does not centre
about the churches as in most communities
of the same size. An old citizen describes the
attitude of the inhabitants toward religion as
one of tolerance merely. Several branches of
the Owen family are Episcopalians. Dancing
as a feature of social life has survived from
community times, and a first-of-May ball, followed
by a dance for children, has long been
fixed in the local calendar.</p>

<p>Thus Robert Owen&#8217;s brief experiment, failing
of his purpose, led to the founding of an
American family whose members have shown
unusual talents, creditable alike to their distinguished
progenitor and to the State which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
became, by chance, their home. He failed to
establish an asylum for the oppressed, as he
had intended, but he was responsible for the
impulse that made of his village a centre of
scientific inquiry and the home of men of
renown. It is impossible to separate the New
Harmony of to-day from the village of the past.
At every turn, the buildings of the Rappites
and the traces of Owen&#8217;s disciples suggest the
old times; and descendants of the Owens,
Fretageots, Beales, Fauntleroys, Dransfields,
Wheatcrofts, and many others dating back to
community times, still live there. New Harmony
is a pleasant place in May and June,
when the great lines of maples in the broad
streets are at their best, and all the quiet valley
is fresh and green. It invites by its air of
antiquity and peace; the sheltered life is still
possible there. In the present, it is the ideal
Western village; in its memories it marks the
first high tide of cultivation at the West.</p>

<small>THE HOOSIER INTERPRETED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> rural type in Indiana has found notable
interpretation at the hands of two writers who,
working independently of each other and at
different periods, have made records of great
social and literary value and interest. As
already indicated, country life at the West and
Southwest has not varied widely in different
communities. The same social conditions and
peculiarities of speech have been observable in
many regions deriving population from common
sources; but the type found in the Ohio
Valley was best defined in Indiana, and it has
gained its greatest fame through the interpretations
of Edward Eggleston and James Whitcomb
Riley. Their outlook on life has been
wholly different, and their literary methods
have been antipodal; but they have both been
keen observers of the rural Indianians, though
of different generations. They meet in a strong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
affection for their native soil, and in an appreciation
of the essential domesticity and moral
enlightenment of the people they depict.</p>


<h3>I. <i>Edward Eggleston</i></h3>

<p>Switzerland County lies in the far southeastern
corner of the State, and Vevay, its principal
town and capital, is on the Ohio River. The
name of the county is explained by the fact of its
settlement by Swiss immigrants, who were drawn
thither by the supposed adaptability of the soil
to the growth of the grape. Vevay lies about
midway between Louisville and Cincinnati, and
the steamboats plying between these two cities
are its only medium of communication with the
world, as no railway touches it. It was to this
pretty village that Joseph Cary Eggleston, the
father of Edward and George Cary Eggleston,
came in 1832. The impression has been
abroad that the author of &#8220;The Hoosier
Schoolmaster&#8221; was himself reared amid the
squalor and ignorance which he described so
vividly, but this is without foundation of fact.
The Egglestons were of good Virginia stock,
and the members of the Indiana branch of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
family were cultivated people. Joseph Cary
was graduated from William and Mary College
in his seventeenth year with high honors. He
had studied law before he left Virginia, and
the fourteen years of his life that remained to
him after his removal to Indiana were spent in
the successful practice of his profession. He
was, moreover, popular in the community, for
he sat in both branches of the General Assembly,
and was nominated for representative in
Congress, but failed of election. He married,
soon after reaching Indiana, the daughter of
George Craig, of Craig township, in Switzerland
County. The Craigs were of a distinguished
Kentucky family, and, like the
Egglestons, looked back to a Virginia ancestry.
Edward Eggleston was born at Vevay in 1837,
and has never failed to speak with great cordiality
and affection of the pretty river town whose
chief distinction lies in his own attainments.
He has even taken occasion in recent years<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> to
rebuke &#8220;a certain condescension in New Englanders,&#8221;
which had prompted the <i>Atlantic
Monthly</i> to comment on the hardship it must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
have been &#8220;to a highly organized man&#8221; to be
born in southern Indiana in the crude early
years of the nineteenth century. Dr. Eggleston
declares that he has retained enough of local
prejudice to feel that he would have lost more
than he could have gained had Plymouth Rock
or Beacon Hill been his birthplace rather than
Vevay. He was sensitive to the loveliness of
the Indiana spring and summer, and has paid
tribute to it in words which it is a pleasure to
repeat:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The sound of the anvil in the smithy, and the soft
clatter of remote cow-bells on the &#8216;commons,&#8217; linger in
my mind as memories inseparable from my boyhood in
Vevay. A certain poetic feeling which characterized me
from childhood, and which, perhaps, finally determined
my course toward literary pursuits, was nourished by my
delight in the noble scenery about Vevay, Madison, and
New Albany, in which places I lived at various times.
My brother George and myself were walkers, partly
because our father had been one before us. Nothing
could be finer than our all-day excursions to the woods
in search of hickory-nuts, wild grapes, blackberries, paw-paws,
or of nothing at all but the sheer pleasure of wandering
in one of the noblest forests that it ever fell to a
boy&#8217;s lot to have for a playground. Then, too, when we
had some business five or twenty miles away, we scorned
to take the steamboat, but just set out afoot along the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
river bank, getting no end of pleasure out of the walk, and
out of that sense of power which unusual fatigue, cheerfully
borne, always gives.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Dr. Eggleston&#8217;s early life was full of vicissitude,
but he has himself disclaimed credit for
being what is called &#8220;a self-made man.&#8221; It is
true that he had his own way to make, in great
measure, but he began with all the benefits
of good ancestry, and he was, in his own
phrase, &#8220;born into an intellectual atmosphere.&#8221;
Joseph Cary Eggleston, who died when Edward
was only nine years old, provided in his will
for the exchange of his law library for books
of general interest, that his children might
have good literature about them in their formative
years&mdash;a direction that was followed
faithfully by his widow. The boy Edward
grew up with the ideal of a scholarly father
before him, and with an ambition to know
books and to read other languages than his
own. He learned also the mystery of type-setting,
and contributed items to the Vevay
<i>Reveille</i>, duly &#8220;set up.&#8221; Dr. Eggleston records
that in his primary schooling, conducted by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
his mother, he proved himself a dull scholar,
but that some kind of climacteric was passed
in his tenth year, and that thenceforward he
was the pride of his teachers. Manual training
was hardly dreamed of in those days,
but Joseph Eggleston had an appreciation of
its value and left what Edward has described
as &#8220;a solemn injunction that his sons should
be sent to the country every summer and
taught manual labor on a farm.&#8221; This injunction
was carefully obeyed, so that Edward
Eggleston had an actual experience of farming
and a contact with farm folk that was a part
of his preparation for the writing of the tales
that gave him his first fame. Judge Miles
Eggleston, Joseph&#8217;s brother, was more distinctly
an Indianian than any other member
of the family by reason of his long residence
in the State and his public services. Guilford
Eggleston, Joseph Eggleston&#8217;s cousin, was identified
with the family life at Vevay. He was
a man of many accomplishments, and left a
deep impression on Edward Eggleston, who
has spoken of his brilliant talk as a perpetual
inspiration: &#8220;He incessantly stimulated my love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
for literature, guided my choice of books,
taught me to make a commonplace book of my
reading, and by his conversation and example
made me feel that to lead an intellectual life
was the most laudable pursuit of a human
being.&#8221; The direction thus given to the boyish
impulse, and the atmosphere of his home,
were of great importance to Edward, for of
systematic schooling he was to know little. He
was never but once in his life able to spend
three consecutive months in school, and after
he reached his tenth year the sum of his schooling
was only eighteen months.</p>

<p>Joseph Eggleston had foreseen his own death
and provided in various ways for the education
of his sons. He purchased a scholarship in
Asbury (DePauw) College, but continued ill
health made it impossible for Edward to avail
himself of its benefits, though his younger
brother, George Cary, became a student there.
Just what Edward Eggleston lost by his irregular
schooling, which was almost wholly independent
of instructors in the usual sense of
the term, is hardly a profitable subject for speculation.
By following his own bent, he strengthened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
himself along lines of natural preference,
and he formed that habit of wise selection and
rejection which in itself marks the educated
man. Although schoolhouse doors were closed
against him on account of his precarious health,
he was nevertheless permitted to court death
by close application in home study. He acquired,
by the time he reached his twenty-fifth
year, some knowledge of six or seven languages,
and a familiar acquaintance with classical English
and French poetry. He knew both the
English and French dramatic literature, though,
having been bred in the strictest teaching of the
Methodists of that day, he read few novels,
and he gives his own testimony that he should
have esteemed it &#8220;a damnable sin to see a
play on the stage.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Edward Eggleston was in his twelfth
year, his mother remarried, taking for her husband
the Rev. William Terrell, a Methodist
minister. This change brought with it a wider
horizon for the boy, as his stepfather&#8217;s duties
led the family away from Vevay to Madison
and New Albany, also on the Ohio, but larger
towns than Vevay. When sixteen, he spent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
more than a year with his father&#8217;s family in
Virginia. The sharp transition from the conditions
in the newer to those of the older country
quickened his powers of observation. The
tribulations of the Western pioneers had been
discussed in his hearing by his elders during
the most impressionable years of his childhood;
his grandfather Craig&#8217;s stone house was a reminder
of times not remote when the Indians
were a daily menace; and the recitals of the
wandering apostles of Methodism in his mother&#8217;s
house had given him further contact with the
adventure and romance of pioneer life. Virginia
opened new vistas, and the novel conditions
of life that he found there extended his
knowledge of men and manners, and afforded
an opportunity for criticism and comparison
that was of definite value. He found himself
cousin to a considerable part of the population,
and this wide relationship gave him an acquaintance
with the charming social life of old Virginia;
but he counted himself an abolitionist,
he says, from the time of this visit.</p>

<p>The abundant vitality of Dr. Eggleston&#8217;s
later years has been so strikingly characteristic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
that it is difficult to believe that ill health
followed him from semi-invalid boyhood into
manhood; but the year after his return from
Virginia he was sent to Minnesota in the hope
that the change might benefit him, and the
kind fates thus threw him into still other and
different experiences. He was in the new
Northwest when the free-soil excitement in
Kansas thrilled the country, and he set out
afoot, with a dirk knife as his only weapon,
for the scene of conflict. He has himself
described the failure and result of this excursion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;After weeks of weary walking and nights spent in the
discomforts of frontier cabins, I grew sick at heart and
longed for the companionship and refinements of home.
I was rather glad to learn that men from the free States
were entirely shut out of the besieged territory on the
Iowa side. My moccasins were worn out, my feet were
sore, my little stock of money was failing, and I was tired
of husbanding it by eating crackers and cheese. I turned
eastward at a point west of Cedar Falls, crossed the Mississippi
at Muscatine, and after walking in all three or four
hundred miles, I at length boarded a railway train at a
station near Galesburg, and reached my nearest relatives
after an enforced fast of twenty-four hours, without a cent
in my pocket, and looking, in my soiled and travel-worn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
garments, like a young border ruffian. I had left home a
pale invalid; I returned sun-browned and well.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>But this gain in bodily strength was not to
profit him long. He had been bred in the
Methodist faith; his stepfather was a minister
of wide reputation in this denomination, and
the youth, with his studious disposition and
gift for speech, turned naturally to the ministry.
He has said of himself that an inward
conflict between his predisposition to literary
work and the tendency to religion and philanthropy
began in boyhood and has continued
throughout his life. There were times in his
youth when his love for literature seemed an
idolatry, and once in a repentant mood he
destroyed his youthful manuscripts and resolved
to abandon literature. He was now
launched upon the Methodist circuit rider&#8217;s
life of hardship and peril, covering a four
weeks&#8217; itinerary in the county of which New
Albany is the capital, and performing his duties
with such diligence that in six months he
was again a wreck. He therefore removed
to Minnesota, and continued in the ministry,
save for intervals of physical prostration, until,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
in 1866, he accepted the editorship of <i>The
Little Corporal</i>, a popular juvenile periodical
published at Chicago, and from that beginning
was irresistibly drawn to the business of making
books. In 1874, he became pastor of a church
in Brooklyn, to which he gave the name of
the Church of Christian Endeavor, and which
sought to make sunshine in shady places. It
was, indeed, the &#8220;Church of the Best Licks,&#8221;
of the &#8220;Hoosier Schoolmaster,&#8221; slightly conventionalized.
Dr. Eggleston continued in the
pastorate for five years, devoting himself to
his work with his accustomed zeal and enthusiasm,
which resulted in another collapse. He
then retired finally from the ministry; but the
phrase, &#8220;Christian Endeavor,&#8221; first applied by
Dr. Eggleston to his Brooklyn church, is widely
known as the name of a society of young
people.</p>

<p>Unconscious preparation for a life-employment
has rarely been more clearly exemplified
in American literature than in the case of Dr.
Eggleston. This is not true as to his novels
of Western life merely, but as to the later
historical writing in which he has so successfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
detected and appraised various aspects of
our social growth. His early experiences at the
West were indelibly written in his memory, and
though he did not at once transcribe them,
his work as editor sharpened his instincts
and helped him to an appreciation of his own
material. His removal to New York in 1870
was another fortunate step of preparation, for
it gave him a perspective which he could
not have gained had he remained at the West.
He wrote almost immediately &#8220;The Hoosier
Schoolmaster,&#8221; the first draft, designed for
<i>Hearth and Home</i>, being in the form of a
short story, which he extended to its present
form at the suggestion of one of the proprietors
of the periodical. The reading of Taine&#8217;s
&#8220;Art in the Netherlands&#8221; was the quickening
influence that led to the writing of the story.
Dr. Eggleston learned from Taine that an
artist should paint what he sees, and he therefore
undertook to portray the illiterate people
of southern Indiana. The story was published
in book form and gained wide popularity, which
has not diminished in the thirty years since its
appearance. Dr. Eggleston has been criticised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
severely in Indiana for the series of novels
that began with &#8220;The Hoosier Schoolmaster,&#8221;
but this criticism has come largely from a new
generation that does not view these tales in
the light of history, and is, therefore, hardly
competent to pass on their veracity. By the
legal tests for expert witnesses Dr. Eggleston
is certainly qualified to speak; his own experience
and the social evolution of the people
of Indiana contribute to the creation of his
competency; and when we add to these considerations
his instinctive interest in the beginnings
and tendencies of American life, it is
not possible to reject him. He knew, as he
says, &#8220;the antique Hoosier.&#8221; The Indiana of
1850 was very different from that of 1870, and
Dr. Eggleston was looking backward a score
of years when he created Ralph Hartsook,
the youthful schoolmaster, and threw about
him an atmosphere of ignorance and vice.
The story is an instructive footnote to the
history of education in Indiana. &#8220;Bud Means&#8221;
is of the second generation of Hoosiers&mdash;the
generation which, outside of the first social
order, had little or no benefit of education, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
which sank to the condition of illiteracy that
awakened presently the efforts of the faithful
few who won the fight for free schools. Courage
preceded knowledge as a requirement of
pedagogues in the period of which Dr. Eggleston
wrote. &#8220;&#8216;Lickin&#8217; and larnin&#8217; goes together;
no lickin&#8217;, no larnin&#8217;,&#8217; declared Pete Jones.&#8221;
The student who may hereafter scan the educational
history of Indiana and read with dismay
the statistics compiled by Mills, will welcome
this unadorned tale, that illuminates and confirms
the dry facts of the statistician. Eggleston,
the novelist, kept Eggleston, the preacher,
well in hand, and there is no tedious moralizing
in the book. It is not difficult to understand
the prompt recognition of the story or its long-continued
attraction. The subject was novel,
the characters were new, and the scene was
set in a region that had never before been
seriously explored by the story-teller. It was,
as an army officer put it, a cavalry dash into
literature. The incidents were linked together
with skill, and their air of entire credibility
has not been lost in the years that have passed
since it surprised and delighted its first readers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
Enjoyment of the story was not limited to
English readers. It was translated into French
by Madame Blanc, and was published in condensed
form in the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>
with the title &#8220;Le Maitre d&#8217;&Eacute;cole de Flat
Creek.&#8221; German and Danish translations followed,
so that &#8220;Bud Means&#8221; has enjoyed
opportunities for foreign travel quite unusual
among his neighbors.</p>

<p>&#8220;The End of the World&#8221; (1872) continued
the series of stories which Dr. Eggleston had
begun in the &#8220;Schoolmaster.&#8221; Religious phenomena
were the most marked social expression
in the time and place of which he wrote.
It was religion that offered to the isolated
people of the new frontier the only relief that
their lives knew from toil, hardship, and danger;
and what appears now, at the distance
of fifty years, to have been a mania was with
them a grave and vital matter. &#8220;The End of
the World&#8221; is a tale of the Millerite excitement,
which swept the country in 1842-1843,
and Dr. Eggleston adapted it very entertainingly
to the purposes of fiction. &#8220;The Mystery of
Metropolisville&#8221; (1873) led away from Indiana<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
into Minnesota, with which Dr. Eggleston had
become acquainted as a minister. Against a
background of the land-booming period, he illustrates
the dangers and temptations of the
pioneers; and while the tale is less satisfactory
than any of the Indiana series, it remains after
thirty years a readable novel. It was hardly
possible for Dr. Eggleston to forget wholly the
people he had known on the Ohio, and he
introduces in &#8220;The Mystery of Metropolisville&#8221;
a Hoosier poet, who had left the &#8220;Waybosh&#8221;
because his literary efforts were not appreciated
there. He carried his ambitions into Minnesota,
became a trapper and land speculator,
and there, to quote from one of his own
stanzas,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;His Hoosier harp hangs on the wild water-willer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Eggleston had been established at New
York for eight years when he wrote &#8220;Roxy&#8221;
(1878), one of the best of his books, and one
which depicts even more vividly than &#8220;The
Hoosier Schoolmaster&#8221; his early environment.
He was now forty-one, and the years that had
added to the sum of his experience had developed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
also his natural instinct for character.
The dramatic quality, too, shows strongly in
this tale, which is, in its moral relation, a kind
of Western &#8220;Scarlet Letter.&#8221; There is more
or less of Vevay in this novel,&mdash;it is not important
to inquire too curiously whether it be
more or less,&mdash;and the pretty river village,
with its slight foreign color, which was derived
from the Swiss residents, the mystery and
novelty of the broad river highway, the simplicity
of the life, its lazy gossip and its
religious enthusiasms, are all depicted with
fidelity. The Bonabys, father and son, the
lurking figure of Nancy, Twonnet, and Roxy,
possess the interest that attaches to fresh types.
The introduction of the volatile Twonnet, a
member of the Swiss Colony, in contrast with
the sober Roxy, the unobtrusive presentation
of the religious problems that held the attention
of the community, and the blending of the
threads of young Bonaby&#8217;s destiny, are accomplished
with skill and power.</p>

<p>In &#8220;The Circuit Rider&#8221; (1874) Dr. Eggleston
crossed the Indiana boundary into southern
Ohio, but for all critical purposes the type remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
the same. Political frontiers do not
deter the novelist, who enjoys extra-territorial
privileges. &#8220;The Circuit Rider&#8221; is not so
entertaining a story as &#8220;Roxy.&#8221; The characters
do not take hold of the imagination
here as in the later book, and those somewhat
vague qualities that combine to the creation
of atmosphere are not blended so effectively.
But as a picture of the strenuous religious
life of the Ohio Valley in the early half of
the century, the story is most important. In
&#8220;Roxy&#8221; the strife between Calvinism and
Wesleyism is more strongly contrasted; but
&#8220;The Circuit Rider&#8221; gives a vivid impression
of a period that was made remarkable by the
heroism and sacrifice of the Methodist evangelists.
After &#8220;Roxy&#8221; Dr. Eggleston did not
return to the field of his early successes until
he wrote &#8220;The Graysons&#8221; (1887). Like &#8220;The
Circuit Rider&#8221; this story is not, geographically
speaking, of Indiana, but it is nevertheless of
that broader Hoosierdom which comprehended
a small part of southern Ohio and considerably
more of Illinois. This is one of the best
of all the Hoosier cycle, and, indeed, one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
the best of American novels. There is not an
inartistic line in the book, and the manner in
which Lincoln is introduced as a character,&mdash;appearing
as the attorney for a boy charged
with murder, and winning his freedom by a
characteristic resort to homely philosophy,&mdash;is
achieved so simply that the reader is left wondering
whether it could really have been the
great Lincoln who participated in one scene,
performed his part, and thereupon disappeared
from the stage. A clumsy artist would have
dwelt upon Lincoln, hinting at his future greatness
and reluctantly dismissing him; Dr. Eggleston
introduces the incident (which is based on
fact) with an inadvertence that enhances its
interest and increases its suggestiveness. The
dialect in this tale is much more critical than
that in any other novel of Dr. Eggleston&#8217;s
Western series. In his earlier stories, written
before the scientific study of American
folk-speech had been undertaken, the dialect
is more general. Dr. Eggleston&#8217;s other works
of fiction are: &#8220;Mr. Blake&#8217;s Walking Stick&#8221;
(1869); &#8220;Book of Queer Stories&#8221; (1870);
&#8220;The Schoolmaster&#8217;s Stories for Boys and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
Girls&#8221; (1874); &#8220;Queer Stories for Boys and
Girls&#8221; (1884); &#8220;The Faith Doctor&#8221; (1891);
&#8220;Duffels&#8221; (1893). &#8220;The Faith Doctor&#8221; is a
novel of New York, in which the prevailing
interest in what Dr. Eggleston called &#8220;aerial
therapeutics&#8221; supplies the motive. &#8220;Duffels&#8221;
is a collection of short stories written at intervals
throughout his literary career, with scenes
laid in many parts of the country, and illustrating
happily the versatility and the story-telling
gift of the author.</p>

<p>Dr. Eggleston began in 1880 researches for a
history of life in the United States. He pursued
his studies abroad, as well as in American
libraries, and assembled at his summer home
on Lake George a large collection of Americana.
The only published result of these studies
thus far is &#8220;The Beginners of a Nation&#8221;
(1896), the most serious, searching, and exhaustive
essay in <i>Kultur-Geschichte</i> yet presented
by an American. The mere politics of our
history and its military incidents had long
received the attention of students, to the exclusion
of the social and domestic. A work such
as Dr. Eggleston has undertaken is vastly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
more difficult and therefore more important,
for it requires original research in the strictest
sense. His other historical works so far completed
are: &#8220;A History of the United States
and its People for the Use of Schools&#8221; (1888);
&#8220;The Household History of the United States
and its People&#8221; (1888); and &#8220;A First Book in
American History&#8221; (1889).</p>

<p>Dr. Eggleston&#8217;s life makes in itself a delightful
story of aspiration and achievement. Many
Americans have experienced hardship and discouragement,
but few have profited so richly
as this novelist and historian by every whim
of fortune. Ill health has menaced him all
his days, but physical infirmity has never conquered
his ambition or diminished his mental
vitality. There is about him an exuberance
of spirits that is not only a distinguishing personal
trait, but a quality of all his stories. And
if ill health in his youth and young manhood
interrupted the orderly course of education, it
also brought him opportunities for acquiring a
broad knowledge of American provincial life
that no school could have given him. When
Dr. Eggleston began to write there was, outside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
of New England, little local literature,
and the value of dialect in interpretative
fiction was only beginning to be understood.
Cable, Page, Harris, Murfree, &#8220;Octave
Thanet,&#8221; were names unknown to the catalogues
when &#8220;The Hoosier Schoolmaster&#8221; appeared.
Mark Twain and Bret Harte were well
embarked upon their careers; but the one was
a humorist and the other a romanticist, and
neither had undertaken to reproduce local
speech accurately. Dr. Eggleston was the
pioneer provincial realist; and if, as he says,
the great American novel is being written in
sections, he certainly contributed early chapters,
and indicated the lines to be followed.</p>

<p>His marriage, in 1891, to Frances E. Goode,
a granddaughter of his father&#8217;s cousin, Judge
Miles Cary Eggleston, renewed ties with Indiana
that had never been wholly broken during
long years of absence. He has often been a
visitor to Madison, which was Mrs. Eggleston&#8217;s
home, and he spent the winter of 1899
in that beautiful and tranquil town.</p>

<h3>II. <i>James Whitcomb Riley</i></h3>

<p>Crabbe and Burns are Mr. Riley&#8217;s forefathers
in literature. Crabbe was the pioneer
in what may be called the realism of poetry;
it was he who rejected the romantic pastoralism
that had so long peopled the British fields
with nymphs and shepherds, and introduced
the crude but actual country folk of England.
The humor, the bold democracy, and the social
sophistication that he lacked were supplied in
his own day by Burns, and Burns had, too, the
singing instinct and the bolder art of which
there are no traces in Crabbe. Something of
Crabbe&#8217;s realism and Burns&#8217;s humor and philosophy
are agreeably combined in Mr. Riley.
His first successes were achieved in the portrayal
of the Indiana country and village folk
in dialect. He has rarely seen fit to vary his
subject, and he has been faithful to the environment
from which he derived his inspiration.
James Whitcomb Riley is an interesting instance&mdash;perhaps,
after Whittier, the most
striking in our literature&mdash;of a natural poet,
taking his texts from the familiar scenes and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
incidents of his own daily walks, and owing
little or nothing to the schools. He was born
at Greenfield, the seat of Hancock County, in
1849. His father, Reuben A. Riley, was a
native of Pennsylvania, of Dutch antecedents,
though there is a tradition of Irish ancestry in
the family. He was a lawyer, who enjoyed a
wide reputation as an advocate, and was long
reckoned among the most effective political
speakers in Indiana. He was a discriminating
reader and an occasional writer of both prose
and verse. The poet&#8217;s mother was a Marine,
of a family in which an aptness for rhyming
was characteristic. The Greenfield schools
have always been excellent, and young Riley
was fortunate in having for his teacher Lee O.
Harris, himself a poet, who tried to adapt the
curriculum of the Hancock County schools to
the needs of an unusual pupil in whom imagination
predominated to the exclusion of mathematics.</p>

<p>Learning is, as Higginson has aptly condensed
it, not accumulation, but assimilation;
and &#8220;the Hoosier poet&#8221; was born one of those
fortunate men to whom schools are a mere incident<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
of education, but who walk through the
world with their eyes open, adding daily to
their stock of knowledge. Bagehot enlarges
on this trait as he discovers it in Shakespeare,
&#8220;throughout all whose writings,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;you see an amazing sympathy with common
people.&#8221; The common people caught
and held the attention of Mr. Riley, and as
the annalist of their simple lives he established
himself firmly in public affection. The half a
dozen colleges within a radius of fifty miles of
his home did not attract him; he was bred to
no business, but followed in a tentative way
occupations that brought him into contact with
people. He began to write because he felt the
impulse, and not because he breathed a literary
atmosphere or looked forward to a literary
career. His imagination needed some outlet,
and he made verses just as he drew pictures or
acquired a knack at playing the guitar, taking
one talent about as seriously as the other. A
Western county seat, with its daily advent of
pilgrims from the farms, affords an entertaining
panorama for a bright boy, and Mr. Riley
began in his youth that careful observation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
the Indiana country folk, their ways and their
speech, that was later to afford him a seemingly
inexhaustible supply of material.</p>

<p>He had in his younger days something of
Artemus Ward&#8217;s fondness for a hoax, and
he wrote &#8220;Leonaine,&#8221; in imitation of Poe&#8217;s
manner, with so marked success that several
critics of discernment received the poem, and
the story of its discovery in an old school
reader, in good faith. In the experimental period
of his career he read widely and to good
purpose, learning the mechanics of prosody
from the best models. His ear was naturally
good, and he was distinctly original in his ideas
of form. He delighted in the manipulation of
words into odd and surprising combinations,
and though the results were not always dignified,
they were, nevertheless, curious and amusing,
and brought him a degree of local fame.
Mr. Riley&#8217;s contributions were wholly to newspapers
through many years, during which the
more deliberate periodicals would have none of
him. He printed poems in the <i>Herald</i>, an Indianapolis
weekly paper, in which the poems of
Edith M. Thomas and others who have since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
gained a literary reputation first saw the light;
and having attracted the attention of E. B. Martindale,
the owner of the Indianapolis <i>Journal</i>,
he was regularly employed on that paper, between
1877 and 1885, printing many of his
best pieces there. He had the pleasure of
seeing his verses widely copied at that period,
when the newspaper press was his only medium
of communication, and before he had printed a
volume. His first marked recognition followed
the publication in the <i>Journal</i> of a series of
poems signed &#8220;Benj. F. Johnson, of Boone,&#8221;
which not only awakened wide interest, but
gave direction to a talent that had theretofore
been without definite aim. He encouraged the
idea that the poems were really the work of a
countryman, and prefaced them with letters in
prose to add to their air of authenticity, much
as Lowell introduced the &#8220;Biglow Papers.&#8221;
This series included &#8220;Thoughts fer the Discuraged
Farmer,&#8221; &#8220;When the Frost is on the
Punkin,&#8221; and &#8220;To My Old Friend, William
Leachman,&#8221; which were winningly unaffected
and simple, bearing out capitally the impression
of a bucolic poet celebrating his own joys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
and sorrows. The charm of the &#8220;Benj. F.
Johnson&#8221; series lay in their perfect suggestion
of a whimsical, lovable character, and wherever
Mr. Riley follows the method employed first
in those pieces, he never fails of his effect.</p>

<p>It should be remembered, in passing from
Riley masquerading as &#8220;Benj. F. Johnson&#8221;
to Riley undisguised, that two kinds of dialect
are represented. The Boone County poet&#8217;s
contributions are printed as the old farmer is
supposed to have written them, not as reported
by a critical listener. There is a difference
between the attempt of an illiterate man to
express his own ideas on paper, and a transcript
of his utterances set down by one trained
to the business&mdash;the vernacular as observed
and recorded by a conscious artist. In every
community there is a local humorist, a sayer
of quaint things, whose oddities of speech gain
wide acceptance and circulation, and Mr. Riley
is his discoverer in Indiana. Lowell, with his
own New England particularly in mind, said
that &#8220;almost every county has some good die-sinker
in phrase, whose mintage passes into the
currency of the whole neighborhood&#8221;; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
this may be applied generally to the South
and West. Mr. Riley writes always with his
eye on a character; and those who question
his dialect do not understand that there is
ever present in his mind a real individual.
The feeling and the incident are not peculiar
to the type; they usually lie within the range
of universal experience; but the expression, the
manner, the figure of the subject, are suggested
in the poem, not by speech alone, but
by the lilt of the line and the form of the
stanza. Mr. Riley is more interested in odd
characters, possessing marked eccentricities,
than in the common, normal type of the farm
or the country town, and the dialect that he
employs often departs from the usual vocabulary
of the illiterate in the field he studies, and
follows lines of individual idiosyncrasy. The
shrewdly humorous farmer who is a whimsical
philosopher and rude moralist delights him.
This character appears frequently in his poems,
often mourning for the old times, now delighting
in &#8220;noon-time an&#8217; June-time, down around
the river&#8221;; and again expressing contentment
with his own lot, averring that &#8220;they&#8217;s nothin&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
much patheticker &#8217;n just a-bein&#8217; rich.&#8221; To
these characters he gives a dialect that is
fuller than the usual rural speech: <i>ministratin&#8217;</i>
(ministering), <i>resignated</i> (resigned), <i>artificialer</i>
(more artificial), <i>competenter</i> (more competent),
<i>tractabler</i> (more tractable), and <i>familiously</i>
(familiarly), not being properly in the Hoosier
<i>lingua rustica</i>, but easily conceivable as possible
deviations. Mr. Riley has been criticised
for imputing to his characters such phrases
as &#8220;when the army broke out&#8221; and &#8220;durin&#8217;
the army,&#8221; referring to the Civil War, and
many careful observers declare that he could
never have heard these phrases; but very
likely he has heard them from the eccentric
countrymen for whom he has so strong an
affinity; or he may have coined them outright
as essential to the interpretation of such
characters. In the main, however, he may be
followed safely as an accurate guide in the
speech of the Southeastern element of the
population, and his questionable usages and inconsistencies
are few and slight, as the phrase
&#8220;don&#8217;t you know,&#8221; which does not always
ring true, or &#8220;again&#8221; and &#8220;agin,&#8221; used interchangeably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
and evidently as the rhyme may
hint. The abrupt beginning of a sentence,
frequently noticed in Mr. Riley&#8217;s dialect verses,
is natural. The illiterate often experience difficulty
in opening a conversation, expressing
only a fragment, to which an interlocutor
must prefix for himself the unspoken phrases.
There is no imposition in Mr. Riley&#8217;s dialect,
for his amplifications of it are always for the
purpose of aiding in the suggestion of a character
as he conceives it; he does not pretend
that he portrays in such instances a type
found at every cross-roads. &#8220;Doc Sifers&#8221; and
&#8220;The Raggedy Man&#8221; are not peculiar to
Indiana, but have their respective counterparts
in such characters as Mark Twain&#8217;s &#8220;Pudd&#8217;n-head
Wilson&#8221; and the wayside tramp, who
has lately been a feature of farce comedy
rather than of our social economy. &#8220;Fessler&#8217;s
Bees,&#8221; &#8220;Nothin&#8217; to say,&#8221; &#8220;Down to the Capital,&#8221;
&#8220;A Liz-town Humorist,&#8221; and &#8220;Squire
Hawkins&#8217;s Story&#8221; show Mr. Riley at his happiest
as a delineator of the rural type. In
these sketches he gives in brief compass the
effect of little dramas, now humorous, now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
touched with simple and natural pathos, and
showing a nice appreciation of the color of
language which is quite as essential in dialect
as in pure English. But it matters little that
the <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> change, or that the literary
method varies; the same kindliness, the
same blending of humor and pathos, and the
same background of &#8220;green fields and running
brooks&#8221; characterize all. &#8220;The crude
man is,&#8221; the poet believes, &#8220;generally moral,&#8221;
and the Riley Hoosier is intuitively religious,
and is distinguished by his rectitude and sense
of justice.</p>

<p>Mr. Riley made his work effective through
the possession of a sound instinct for appraising
his material, combined with a good sense
of proportion. His touch grew steadily firmer,
and he became more fastidious as the public
made greater demands upon him; for while
his poems in dialect gained him a hearing,
he strove earnestly for excellence in the use
of literary English. He has written many
poems of sentiment gracefully and musically,
and with no suggestion of dialect. Abundant
instances of his felicity in the strain of retrospect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
and musing might be cited. The same
chords have been struck time and time again;
but they take new life when he touches them,
as in &#8220;The All-Golden&#8221;:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is not the farmer alone whose simple virtues
appeal to him; but rugged manhood anywhere
commands his tribute, and he has hardly
written a more touching lyric than &#8220;Away,&#8221;
whose subject was an Indiana soldier:&mdash;</p>

<p>He has his own manner of expressing an
idea, and this individuality is so marked that
it might lead to the belief that he had
little acquaintance with the classic English
writers. But his series of imitations, including
the prose of Scott and Dickens and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
the characteristic poems of Tennyson and
Longfellow, are certainly the work of one who
reads to good purpose and has a feeling for
style. When he writes naturally there is no
trace of bookishness in his work; he rarely or
never invokes the mythologies, though it has
sometimes pleased him to imagine Pan piping
in Hoosier orchards. He is read and quoted
by many who are not habitual readers of
poetry&mdash;who would consider it a sign of
weakness to be caught in the act of reading
poems of any kind, but who tolerate sentiment
in him because he makes it perfectly
natural and surrounds it with a familiar atmosphere
of reality. The average man must be
trapped into any display of emotion, and Mr.
Riley spreads for him many nets from which
there is no escape, as in &#8220;Nothin&#8217; to say, my
daughter,&#8221; where the subject is the loneliness
and isolation of the father whose daughter is
about to marry, and who faces the situation
clumsily, in the manner of all fathers, rich or
poor. The remembrance of the dead wife
and mother adds to the pathos here. The old
man turns naturally to the thought of her:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>The drolleries of childhood have furnished
Mr. Riley subjects for some of his most
original and popular verses. Here, again, he
does not accept the conventional children of
literature, whom he calls &#8220;the refined children,
the very proper children&mdash;the studiously
thoughtful, poetic children&#8221;; but he seeks
&#8220;the rough-and-tumble little fellows &#8216;in hodden
gray,&#8217; with frowzly heads, begrimed but
laughing faces, and such awful vulgarities of
naturalness, and crimes of simplicity, and brazen
faith and trust, and love of life and everybody
in it!&#8221; It is in this spirit that he presents
now the na&iuml;ve, now the perversely erring, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
again the eerie and elfish child. He is a
master of those enchantments of childhood
that transfigure and illumine and create a
world of the imagination for the young that
is undiscoverable save to the elect few. He
does not write patronizingly to his audience;
but listens, as one should listen in the realm
of childhood, with serious attention, and then
becomes an amanuensis, transcribing the children&#8217;s
legends and guesses at the riddle of
existence in their own language. &#8220;The Raggedy
Man&#8221; is not a romantic figure; he is
the shabby chore-man of the well-to-do folk
in the country town, and the friend and oracle
of small boys. His mind is filled with rare
lore, he&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Knows &#8217;bout Giunts, an&#8217; Griffuns an&#8217; Elves</div>
<div class="verse">An&#8217; the Squidgicum-Squees &#8217;at swallers therselves!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And he may be responsible, too, for &#8220;Little
Orphant Annie&#8217;s&#8221; knowledge of the &#8220;Gobble-uns,&#8221;
which Mr. Riley turned into the most
successful of all his juvenile pieces. He reproduces
most vividly a child&#8217;s eager, breathless
manner of speech, and the elisions and variations
that make the child-dialect. Interspersed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
through &#8220;The Child World,&#8221; a long poem in
rhymed couplets, are a number of droll juvenile
recitatives; but this poem has a much greater
value than at first appears. It presents an
excellent picture of domestic life in a western
country town, and the town is Mr. Riley&#8217;s own
Greenfield, on the National Road. This poem
is a faithful chronicle, lively and humorous, full
of the local atmosphere, and never dull. The
descriptions of the characters are in Mr. Riley&#8217;s
happiest vein: the father of the house, a lawyer
and leading citizen; the patient mother;
the children with their various interests, leading
up to &#8220;Uncle Mart,&#8221; the printer, who aspired
to be an actor&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;He joyed in verse-quotations&mdash;which he took</div>
<div class="verse">Out of the old &#8216;Type Foundry Specimen Book.&#8217;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>The poem is written in free, colloquial English,
broken by lapses into the vernacular. It contains
some of his best writing, and proves him
to possess a range and breadth of vision that
are not denoted in his lyrical pieces alone.
&#8220;The Flying Islands of the Night, a fantastic
drama in verse,&#8221; his only other effort of length,
was written earlier. It abounds in the curious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
and capricious, but it lacks in simplicity and
reserve&mdash;qualities that have steadily grown
in him.</p>

<p>Humor is pre&euml;minent in Mr. Riley, and it
suggests that of Dickens in its kinship with
pathos. It seems to be peculiar to the literature
of lowly life that there is heartache beneath
much of its gayety, and tears are almost inevitably
associated with its laughter. Mr. Riley
never satirizes, never ridicules his creations;
his attitude is always that of the kindly and
admiring advocate; and it is by enlisting the
sympathy of his readers, suggesting much to
their feeling and imagination, and awakening
in them a response that aids and supplements
his own work, that Mr. Riley has won his way
to the popular heart. The restraints of fixed
forms have not interfered with his adequate
expression of pure feeling. This is proved by
the sonnet, &#8220;When She Comes Home Again,&#8221;
which is one of the tenderest of his poems.
In the day that saw many of his contemporaries
in the younger choir of poets carving
cherry stones of verse after French patterns
he found old English models sufficient, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
his own whim supplied all the variety he
needed. Heroic themes have not tempted
him; he has never attained sonority or power,
and has never needed them; but melody and
sweetness and a singular gift of invention
distinguish him.</p>

<p>Many imitators have paid tribute to Mr.
Riley&#8217;s dialect verse, for most can grow the
flowers after the seed have been freely blown
in the market-place. Perhaps the best compliment
that can be paid to Mr. Riley&#8217;s essential
veracity is to compare the verse of those who
have made attempts similar to his own. He is,
for example, a much better artist than Will
Carleton, who came before him, and whose
&#8220;Farm Ballads&#8221; are deficient in humor; and
he possesses a breadth of sympathy and a depth
of sincerity that Eugene Field did not attain in
dialect verse, though Field&#8217;s versatility and fecundity
were amazing. There is nowhere in Mr.
Riley a trace of the coarse brutality with which
Mr. Hamlin Garland, for example, stamps the
life of a region lying farther west. There is
no point of contact between Lowell and Mr.
Riley in their dialectic performances, as civic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
matters do not interest the Indianian; and his
view of the Civil War becomes naturally that
of the countryman who looks back with wistful
melancholy, not to the national danger and dread,
but to the neighborhood&#8217;s glory and sorrow, as
in &#8220;Good-by, Jim.&#8221; It might also be said that
Mr. Riley has never put the thoughts of statesmen
into the mouths of countrymen, as Lowell
did, consistency being one of his qualities. There
has sprung up in Mr. Riley&#8217;s time a choir of
versifiers who are journalistic rather than literary,
and who write for the day, much as the
reporters do. Mr. Riley, more than any one
else, has furnished the models for these, and
it would seem that verses could be multiplied
interminably, or so long as such refrains as
&#8220;When father winds the clock&#8221; and &#8220;The hymns
that mother used to sing&#8221; can be found for
texts.</p>

<p>With the publication of the &#8220;Benj. F. Johnson&#8221;
poems in a paper-covered booklet, Mr.
Riley&#8217;s literary career began. The intervening
years have brought him continuous applause;
his books of verse have been sold widely in this
country and in England, and that, too, in &#8220;the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
twilight of the poets,&#8221; with its contemporaneous
oblivion for many who have labored bravely in
the paths of song. He early added to his reputation
as a writer that of a most successful
reader of his own poems, and on both sides of
the Atlantic his work and his unique personality
have won for him the friendship of many
distinguished literary men of the day. It is to
be said that the devotion of the people of his
own State to their poet, from first to last, has
been marked by a cordiality and loyalty that
might well be the envy of any man in any field
of endeavor. No other Western poet has ever
occupied a similar place; and the reciprocal
devotion, on the other hand, of the poet to his
own people, is not less noteworthy or admirable.
He has always resented the suggestion that he
should leave Indiana for Boston or New York,
where he might be more in touch with the
makers of books; and in recent years he purchased
the old family residence at Greenfield,
to which he returns frequently for rest and
inspiration. For fifteen years he has been the
best-known figure in Indianapolis, studying
with tireless attention the faces in the streets,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
nervously ranging the book-stores, and often
sitting down to write a poem at the desk
of some absentee in the <i>Journal</i> office. His
frequent reading and lecturing tours have
been miserable experiences for him, as he is
utterly without the instinct of locality, and has
timidly sat in the hotels of strange towns
for many hours for lack of the courage requisite
for exploration. Precision and correctness
have distinguished him in certain ways,
being marked, for example, in matters of dress
and in his handwriting; his manuscripts are
flawlessly correct, and the slouch and negligence
of the traditional poet are not observed in
him.</p>

<p>His long list of books includes &#8220;Afterwhiles&#8221;
(1887); &#8220;Pipes of Pan at Zekesbury&#8221; (1888);
&#8220;Old-fashioned Roses&#8221; (1889); &#8220;Rhymes of
Childhood&#8221; (1891); and &#8220;Poems Here at Home&#8221;
(1897); and he has known the luxury of a cosmopolitan
edition of his writings in a series
that embraced the definitive Stevenson. Fame
came to Mr. Riley when he was still young,
and it is only a fair assumption that he has
not exhausted his field, but that he will grow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
more and more secure in it. Serious work it
has not always been possible for him to do,
for his audience learned to expect humor in
all his verses, and refused to be disappointed;
but his ambition lies beyond humorous dialect,
though he finds no fault with the public preference.
All that he writes is welcome, for he
is a preacher of sound optimism and a sincere
believer in the final good that comes to all.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />


<small>CRAWFORDSVILLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is an ineffable charm about an old
town that has outlived its ambition to be a
great city, and Crawfordsville is a fine type
of such a place. The region was settled in
1823, and the Montgomery County people, both
farmers and townfolk, have long been counted
among the sturdiest and most intelligent in the
State. A cultivated society has always existed
at Crawfordsville, and as the seat of Wabash
College it acquired in its youth an academic
air that it has never shaken off. The town
has been called &#8220;The Hoosier Athens,&#8221; by envious
and less favored neighbors. The analogy
is not wholly fortunate, as there are neither
porticoes nor statues on the college campus,
and no Cimon found occupation here, as at
the elder Athens, in tree-planting. Nature had
anticipated the need of &#8220;groves of academe,&#8221;
and the trees about the college and through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
the town are truly of the forest primeval,
giving the agreeable impression of a <i>rus in
urbe</i>. Crawfordsville has often sent young
men elsewhere to find occupation; but if its
commercial attractions have been slight, its
educational advantages have been proportionately
great, and Wabash is able to point to a
long list of successful alumni. The spirit of
change has rarely invaded the college, and men
are now holding chairs who have grown old in
its service. Wabash has been content to do
honest college work and has never made false
pretensions as to its ability to do more. &#8220;Mere
literature,&#8221; as Bagehot fondly called it, has not
been disregarded, and in no college of ampler
endowment have the classics been taught more
sympathetically or intelligently. It is one of
the few colleges remaining at the West which
close their doors to women, although importunate
hands have long besought the wicket.</p>

<p>The honor and dignity of learning have
come to have a real meaning here, not only
to those who seek instruction at the college,
but to the people of the town as well. Wabash
may not have directly influenced those who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
made Crawfordsville a seat of authorship, but
certainly a fortunate chance led makers of
books to seek the congenial atmosphere created
by the college. In such a place one may
not grow rich, but one may dwell contented;
and while coarser commerce has not flourished
greatly, much valuable manuscript has
freighted the east-bound mails from Crawfordsville.
Authorship and scholarship alone
have not engaged the inhabitants. Joseph E.
McDonald, later a senator in Congress, once
lived here, as did also John M. Butler, who
became McDonald&#8217;s law partner at Indianapolis
and one of the ablest men of the Western
bar. Butler&#8217;s son, John Maurice Butler, was
born at Crawfordsville, and his untimely death
(1896) removed the man of most charming
personality, and the keenest wit of his generation
at the capital. Henry Beebee Carrington
had identified himself with Indiana&#8217;s participation
in the War of the Rebellion before
he became (1870-1873) professor of military
science at Wabash. His stay at Crawfordsville
was brief, but the inhabitants prefer to
believe that as he once breathed the Athenian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
air they are entitled to share with Connecticut,
his native State and later home, in the credit
for his writings. The Whitlocks and the
Elstons were among the first settlers, and were
prominent in all the earlier labors of the community.
Henry S. Lane, General Wallace&#8217;s
brother-in-law, was a senator in Congress
(1860-1867), and lived and died here.</p>


<h3>I. <i>General Lew Wallace</i></h3>

<p>General Lew Wallace, whose varied achievements
have contributed so largely to the town&#8217;s
fame, was not born at Crawfordsville, but at
Brookville, in Franklin County, April 10, 1827.
His father, David Wallace, had resigned from
the regular army soon after his graduation from
West Point in 1821. He studied law at Brookville,
and soon began an interesting public career.
He was one of the political giants of the State
in his day, holding many offices and positions of
honor. His first wife, General Wallace&#8217;s mother,
was the daughter of John Test, of a family long
prominent in the State. General Wallace was an
adventurous boy, impatient of all restraint, and
fond of wandering, and he therefore received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
little systematic education; but his father owned
an excellent library, and, as has happened with
other boys who have refused to submit to the
schoolmaster, he found his own way to the book
shelves. He was for a time a student at Hoshour&#8217;s
school at Centerville; and he once ran
away to join an older brother at Wabash; but
he was either unwilling or unable to break his
nomadic habits, and continued to roam the
woods until, at sixteen, his school bills were
audited for the last time. He was beset by
several ambitions; literature, art, and a military
career invited him. He had some skill at sketching,
and painted a portrait of Black Hawk, the
Indian chief, drawing on the family medicine
chest for castor oil to use in mixing his colors.
He also completed a novel, &#8220;The Man at Arms:
A Tale of the Tenth Century,&#8221; of which he remembers
little; but Sulgrove in one of his chronicles
darkly hints that it was of the school of
G. P. R. James. Robert Duncan, clerk of Marion
County, in which Indianapolis is situated, employed
him as copyist, and he varied this prosaic
occupation by reading law in his father&#8217;s office.
The Mexican War now broke upon the country,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
and as Lewis&mdash;the second syllable disappeared
during the Civil War&mdash;had painted a picture
and written a romance, he now turned naturally
to his third ambition. He organized a company
and went south with the First Indiana Infantry.
The regiment saw little of the war, but the campaign
and his personal experience in military
matters confirmed young Wallace&#8217;s purpose to
write a novel of Mexico, for which, by a kind of
prevision and the inspiration of Prescott, he
had already made tentative sketches. On his
return to Indiana he again took up the law, and
practised at Covington until 1852, when he removed
to Crawfordsville, which has ever since
been his home. He presently organized a military
company, known as the &#8220;Montgomery
Guards,&#8221; and equipped it with the Zouave uniform.
This furnished an outlet for his ceaseless
energy, and also for his pocket-book, as the
State contributed nothing to the company&#8217;s support.
He brought it to a high standard of
efficiency, and at the outbreak of the Civil War
it was one of the best-drilled military organizations
in the country. Governor Morton appointed
Mr. Wallace adjutant-general of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
State at the first sign of hostilities, but he
served in this capacity for a short time only,
and organized the Eleventh Indiana Regiment,
with his original Crawfordsville company as
nucleus, and began an active and brilliant
career in the army. Almost immediately his
regiment distinguished itself in West Virginia.
He was a brigadier-general before the capture
of Fort Henry, and was made major-general
for gallantry at Donelson. A year after Shiloh,
a friend called General Wallace&#8217;s attention to
the official reports of that engagement, and he
learned for the first time that he had been censured
for his conduct on the first day of the
battle. He asked at once for a court of inquiry,
which was denied, and a long controversy
followed. This died out for a time, but was
renewed when Grant began the serial publication
of his memoirs. It was always maintained
by General Wallace&#8217;s friends that Grant was
unjust to Wallace; that the Indiana officer
faithfully obeyed orders actually given him;
and certainly no one who ever had any acquaintance
with General Wallace would believe him
capable of intentionally taking a circuitous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
route to a battle-field. The effective service of
his command on the second day of the battle
should forever have stilled criticism; as it was,
Grant wrote in his memoirs&mdash;the last words
that ever came from his pen&mdash;a footnote to his
account of Pittsburg Landing that fairly acquitted
General Wallace of all blame. Much has been
written, by participants and others, touching the
incident, and it has been made the subject of an
exhaustive study by George F. McGinnis.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> While
stationed at Baltimore, in 1864, General Wallace
prevented a Confederate descent upon Washington
by intercepting Jubal Early at Monocacy.
He threw 6,000 men against Early&#8217;s force of
28,000, suffering defeat, but detaining the enemy
until Grant could send re&euml;nforcements from
Virginia. This was one of the most important
of all his military services, and he received for it
Grant&#8217;s cordial praise. General Wallace was a
member of the court that tried the conspirators
implicated in the assassination of Lincoln; and
he was president of the commission that tried and
convicted Captain Henry Wirz, commandant of
Andersonville Prison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>When General Wallace returned to Crawfordsville
at the close of the war he was thirty-eight;
he had served creditably in one war and
with enviable distinction in a second, and he
turned to the arts of peace from a military
experience that had given him wide reputation
and acquaintance among public men of the
Civil War period. He began industriously to
re&euml;stablish himself in his law practice, and
varied his occupation with study and literary
work. &#8220;The Man at Arms,&#8221; his youthful attempt
at &#8220;A Tale of the Tenth Century,&#8221; had
disappeared during his absence in Mexico; but
the ambition to write a romance of the invasion
of Cortez, and his manuscript beginnings of it,
had survived two wars, and he now set about
finishing the story. He had at this time no
definite ambition to become an author, and he
gave his evenings to the writing of &#8220;The Fair
God&#8221; with little idea of ever publishing it. After
its completion he carried it East with him
on a business journey. Whitelaw Reid gave
him an introduction to a Boston publisher, and
the result was the appearance of the tale in
1873. He had spent in all about twelve years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
on the book, part having been written, as already
stated, in his boyhood; and the author&#8217;s
faithfulness to his early purpose through many
years that had brought new duties and obligations
is in keeping with his whole character.</p>

<p>The scenes of &#8220;The Fair God&#8221; were unfamiliar
to the novel reader, and the very names in
the book were somewhat disconcerting; but the
tale was received in the beginning with a fair
degree of interest, and it has ever since enjoyed
a steady sale. The subsequent success of &#8220;Ben
Hur&#8221; directed attention anew to General Wallace&#8217;s
earlier tale, but the romance was something
more than an amateur effort, and time
has not diminished its entertaining qualities.
As a picture of Aztecan civilization it is accurate,
and the incidents are related in an orderly
and natural manner that holds the attention.
The devotion of the people to their religion is
impressive; but the tale is essentially a military
romance. The battle scenes following the
appearance of Cortez and his Spaniards are
described with an animation and an amplitude
that impart to the reader the sense of beholding
a series of great spectacles. The book is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
rich in those surprises which it is the business
of the romancer to produce; and the chapters
descriptive of the battle towers (<i>mantas</i>) which
were among the European&#8217;s resources, and of
the retreat of the invaders, are noisy with the
clang of battle. The prophecies of the mystic
priest Mualox, who sees through the eyes of a
child the coming of the Spaniards, are interesting;
and curiously enough they had their origin
in an incident of General Wallace&#8217;s own experience
in Indiana, showing how the imagination
may play upon the commonplace. When he
lived at Covington, he formed the acquaintance
of a tailor who was deeply interested in the
occult sciences, and who once invited General
Wallace to his shop to witness manifestations
of his powers. The tailor placed his apprentice
under a kind of hypnotic influence, and
told General Wallace to take the boy&#8217;s hand
and to follow in his own mind some route
with whose details he was familiar. General
Wallace obeyed, mentally reviewing a highway
that led to the house of a farmer client.
The boy&#8217;s lips moved, and he coherently
described the road, and presently the farmhouse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
just as General Wallace saw them; then
he abruptly ceased to follow the leader&#8217;s train
of thought. He said that it was night; that
some one came out of the house with a light,
walked about inspecting the barnyard, and then
returned to the house. The boy had now become
exhausted; the tailor revived him, and
General Wallace went on to his home. A few
days later, when the countryman whose farm
had figured in the incident came to town, General
Wallace asked him if he had been at home
at the hour mentioned; he replied that he had
been at home and asleep. Further questioning
elicited the statement that at about the time
of the experiment at the tailor shop he had
been aroused by noises in the barnyard, and
that, fearing some marauder was after his
fowls, he had taken a light and gone out to
see that all was secure.</p>

<p>The friendly reception of &#8220;The Fair God&#8221;
did not awaken any unusual interest in General
Wallace as a writer. He continued at Crawfordsville
the life of a lawyer of polite tastes,
keenly interested in politics. &#8220;The Fair God&#8221;
out of the way, he began almost immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
to cast about for some new literary employment.
In about 1874 it occurred to him to write a novelette,
whose principal incident should be the
meeting of the Wise Men in the Desert and the
birth of Christ. The brief account in the Gospels
had long appealed to his imagination, and
he wrote what is now the first book of &#8220;Ben
Hur,&#8221; intending to offer it to some magazine
for publication as a sketch, with illustrations.
While the manuscript still lay in his desk, he
met on a railway journey an old friend, Colonel
Robert G. Ingersoll, and in the course of conversation
the famous sceptic touched on the subject
of Christianity. General Wallace had always
been indifferent in religious matters, neither
denying nor affirming; but Ingersoll&#8217;s downright
iconoclasm alarmed him. He determined
to investigate the subject and form his own conclusions;
and he began researches and studies
which continued through five years. When he
had concluded, he fully accepted the tenets of
Christian faith, and he had amplified his sketch
of the Wise Men into the novel &#8220;Ben Hur.&#8221;
Continuous labor had not been possible during
the writing of this tale: he had been busy with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
everyday affairs; politics received a share of
his attention; and he became, in 1878, by appointment
of President Hayes, governor of
New Mexico Territory. He lived at Santa F&eacute;
for three years, and much of &#8220;Ben Hur&#8221; was
written in the governor&#8217;s house there. General
Wallace had never visited Palestine when he
wrote &#8220;Ben Hur,&#8221; but there are points of resemblance
between the landscape of New Mexico
and that of the Holy Land, and these were of
assistance. He procured a profile map of Palestine,
and was so attentive to topographical detail
that later, when he visited the scenes of his
story in company with a recognized authority in
ancient history, every feature of the country as
described in the book was verified. An immense
amount of labor is represented in this novel.
Many volumes were consulted in the search for
antiquarian lore, that it might lack nothing
that would aid in conveying an accurate impression
of the period.</p>

<p>The book was capitally planned, striking episodes
falling into place naturally, and not too
abundantly. The meeting of the Wise Men,
the sea fight, and the chariot race are dramatic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
to a degree; but the sombre picture of the
crucifixion is unmarred by excess. The reverence
which characterizes every mention of the
Saviour is the author&#8217;s happiest achievement in
the story. The subject is difficult, but it is
handled with admirable taste and refinement.
However, the book does not depend for continued
attention on its interest as a religious
novel; it is equally noteworthy for its comprehensive
grasp of the politics of the period, its picture
of the various peoples that flowed through
the streets of Jerusalem and Antioch, and the suggestion
of a romantic commerce whose exploits
lay in strange seas and beyond the deserts. Nothing
in the book is accomplished more skilfully
than the slow extinction of the idea of the coming
of a great ruler of the world, to rebuild the throne
of Solomon, and the gradual acceptance of the
spiritual significance of Christ&#8217;s advent; and it
may be taken, in connection with the history of
the novel, as a revelation of the growth in the
author&#8217;s own mind of a belief in the divine Saviour.
Historical novels, particularly those that
look to antiquity for subjects, follow necessarily
certain traditions, and these are observed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
carefully by General Wallace. Scott, more
than any other, helped him, and &#8220;Ivanhoe,&#8221; in
particular, was his model. The writing in &#8220;Ben
Hur&#8221; is uniformly good, and the dialogue in
archaic speech is well sustained. General Wallace
wrote out of an ample vocabulary enriched by
the constant reading of Oriental narrative, and
in his descriptions the epithets are always apposite.
The success of &#8220;Ben Hur&#8221; was not
immediate. It sold slowly for several years,
but it gained steadily in popularity and continues
in favor with the booksellers. It has been
translated into all the European languages, into
Arabic and Japanese, and it is accessible to the
blind in raised-letter. The sale of the copyright
edition in America (1900) exceeds 1,200,000,
which is probably greater than that of &#8220;Uncle
Tom&#8217;s Cabin.&#8221; Many playwrights and actors proposed
to General Wallace from time to time the
dramatization of &#8220;Ben Hur,&#8221; but he feared that
the spirit of reverence, which he had so consistently
communicated to the novel, would be lost
in any play founded upon its incidents. He
declined all offers until, in 1899, a plan was submitted
which met his approval, and in the fall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
of that year the play was given its first presentation
at New York.</p>

<p>When President Garfield appointed General
Wallace minister to Turkey, he wrote across his
commission &#8220;Ben Hur.&#8221; General Wallace
called at the White House, just before leaving
for his post, to pay his respects to the President,
and Garfield said to him: &#8220;I expect another
book from you. Your official duties will not be
so onerous that you cannot write it. Make the
scene Constantinople.&#8221; The opportunity thus
presented for further literary work was a consideration
in accepting the post. The Turkish
occupation of Constantinople is an incident of
great historical importance, and in his search
for material for a new romance, General Wallace
determined to write a tale that should present
a picture of the fierce struggle between
Christian and Moslem. His studies at Constantinople
led to the writing of &#8220;The Prince
of India.&#8221; The Prince is &#8220;The Wandering
Jew.&#8221; He appears as a man of mysterious
gifts, who wields great wealth and power. He
has discovered what he believes to be common
ground upon which all the spiritually minded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
may meet, irrespective of religion. He appears
before the Emperor Constantine and presents
his plan for a universal religious union, but he
horrifies the theologians, and finding the Christians
unsympathetic, he turns to Mohammed,
and bestows upon him the sword of Solomon,
the sign of conquest, which he had found in the
tomb of Hiram, King of Tyre. The tale has
neither the interest of &#8220;Ben Hur&#8221; nor the
novelty and military ardor of &#8220;The Fair
God.&#8221; The subject required deliberate treatment,
and the hero, who is a scholar and a
mystic, naturally deals in words oftener than in
actions.</p>

<p>General Wallace&#8217;s other writings are &#8220;The
Boyhood of Christ&#8221; (1889), and &#8220;The Wooing
of Malkatoon: a Turkish Tale, with Commodus,
a Play&#8221; (1898), both in blank verse.</p>

<p>There is nothing in General Wallace&#8217;s literary
career to encourage hasty and careless workmanship.
His methods have been, from the beginning,
those of a conscientious artist, who
strives for excellence and is capable of cheerfully
casting aside the work of many days if, by additional
labor, he can gain better results. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
parleys with a sentence or debates with a synonym
with a caution that is akin to Oriental diplomacy.
He has probably never written even
a social letter carelessly, and if his correspondence
were to be collected, it would prove to be
of the same quality as his best printed work.
There has always been a dignity in his ambitions.
Military leadership came to him naturally,
and when he took up literature, it was in
a serious way, with subjects that were new and
daring. By making every stroke count, and
paying no heed to changing literary fashions,
he has, in the intervals of unusually varied and
exacting employments, cultivated the literary
art with enviable success.</p>

<p>Heredity and environment explain nothing in
General Wallace. He is an estray from the
Orient, whom Occidental conditions have influenced
little. This is proved by all his imaginative
writing, by his military tastes, by many
qualities of his personality, and by his appearance
and bearing. He has never written of
American life, and the attraction of Mexico as
a field for fiction lay in the splendor and remoteness
of the early civilization of the country,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
combined with the romance of its conquest by
soldiers of Spain. In like manner, &#8220;Ben Hur&#8221;
and &#8220;The Prince of India&#8221; are such subjects as
would naturally appeal to him. His fancy has
delighted always in the thought of pageantry,
conquest, mystery, and mighty deeds; it has
pleased him to contemplate the formal social life
of the old heroic times. The beginning of his
friendship with the Sultan illustrates a sympathy,
native in him, with the Oriental character.
General Wallace had reached Constantinople
after his appointment as minister, but had not
been formally received. On Friday, the Moslem
Sunday, he went with the multitude to see the
Sultan go to prayer. General Wallace was
entitled, by act of Congress, to wear the uniform
of a major-general in the United States
army, and he was clad in all the regalia of the
rank. Between the gate of the imperial park
and the Mosque which the Sultan attended
was a small house, with a platform in front
of it, set apart to strangers, and there General
Wallace viewed the procession. The dark man
in the rich uniform attracted the attention of
the Sultan as he passed, and from the Mosque<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
he sent Osman Pasha, the hero of Plevna, then
marshal of the palace, to learn the identity of
the stranger. On finding that he was the new
American minister awaiting audience, the Sultan
sent an invitation to General Wallace to
accompany him on his return to the palace, an
honor never before accorded to a minister not yet
received. A carriage was sent for the American,
who returned in the brilliant cort&egrave;ge next
to the carriage of the Sultan. The reception at
the palace was particularly distinguished, and
thereafter the relations between the two were
intimate and cordial. The Sultan often summoned
the minister to the palace, sometimes
requesting interviews at the dead of night. All
their conversation was through an interpreter,
as the Sultan knew no English and General
Wallace did not speak French.</p>

<p>There was early stamped upon General Wallace
an air of authority that went well with the
military profession; but later years have softened
this into a courtliness and grace of manner
wholly charming. The Oriental strain in him
has become more and more pronounced, suggesting
that the years spent in the study of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
Eastern history, and his actual contact with
Oriental peoples, have emphasized it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wallace (born Susan Arnold Elston) is
a native of Crawfordsville. Her father was
a pioneer of central Indiana. The homes of his
descendants are grouped in Elston Grove, one
of the prettiest spots in Crawfordsville. General
and Mrs. Wallace were married in 1852,
and she is &#8220;the wife of my youth,&#8221; to whom
&#8220;Ben Hur&#8221; was dedicated. He received so
many consolatory letters based on this inscription,
which seemed to be misunderstood, that
in later editions he changed it, adding &#8220;who
still abides with me.&#8221; Mrs. Wallace began
writing at an early age, both prose and verse.
She has never collected her poems, though several
of them, as &#8220;The Patter of Little Feet,&#8221;
written years ago, are frequently brought to the
attention of a new audience by the newspapers.
She has printed one book of fiction, &#8220;Ginevra&#8221;
(1887), and three books of travel sketches, &#8220;The
Storied Sea&#8221; (1884); &#8220;The Land of the Pueblos&#8221;
(1888); and &#8220;The Repose in Egypt&#8221;
(1888). Mrs. Wallace has a happy manner of
describing places and incidents, and the papers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
in these volumes show the spontaneity and ease
of good letters, and are without the guide-book
taint. They were intended, as the author stated
in the preface to &#8220;The Storied Sea,&#8221; for patient,
gentle souls seeking rest &#8220;from that weariness
known in our dear native land as mental
culture.&#8221; Mrs. Wallace shares her husband&#8217;s
liking for Eastern subjects, and her Egyptian
and Turkish papers, in particular, are delightful
reading.</p>


<h3>II. <i>Maurice Thompson</i></h3>

<p>No other Indianian has lived so faithfully as
Maurice Thompson a life devoted to literary
ideals, and none of his contemporaries among
writers of the West and South has been more
loyally devoted to pure <i>belles-lettres</i> than he.
Abstract beauty has appealed to him more
strongly than to any other writer of the Indiana
group, and he has expressed it in his poems,
through media suggested by his own environment,
with charm and grace. He is a native
of Indiana, having been born at Fairfield, near
Brookville, September 9, 1844. His father was
of Scotch-Irish ancestry; his maternal grandfather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
was of Dutch origin; and both lines
were represented in the Southwestern migration
at the beginning of the century. In
Maurice&#8217;s childhood his father, who was a
Baptist clergyman, made several changes of
residence, all tending southward, removing first
to southeastern Missouri, then to Kentucky,
and again within a few years to the valley of
the Coosawattee in northern Georgia. Here
the senior Thompson became a planter, and
Maurice enjoyed thereafter, until he reached
manhood, a life in which the study of books
was ideally blended with the freedom of the
country. He has always expressed great obligations
to his mother&#8217;s influences during these
years; her literary tastes were sound, and
she imparted to her children the love of good
books, overcoming by her own encouragement
and guidance the absence of schools in their
neighborhood. Tutors were procured for
higher mathematics and the languages; but
the chief impulse to the study of the old literatures
lay in the youth&#8217;s own taste and temperament.
Like Lanier, Hayne, Esten Cooke,
John B. Tabb, and others who were to become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
known in literature, he entered the Confederate
army (1862), and saw hard service until the
surrender. Even these years of soldier experience
did not interrupt wholly his studies, for he
usually managed to carry with him some book
worth reading, the essays of De Quincey and
Carlyle belonging to this period. Mr. Thompson
returned to his father&#8217;s plantation at the
close of the war, and remained there for three
years, continuing his studies as before, but substituting
hard manual labor for the life of pleasant
adventure by field and flood that had given
him from boyhood into early manhood an
intimate acquaintance with wild things. He
now began, of necessity, to accommodate himself
to the changed conditions of the community
and of his own family. He had studied engineering,
and he perfected himself in it, and read
law. Reconstruction moved forward slowly,
and wishing to get as quickly as possible into
a region where his material prospects could
be improved, he went to Crawfordsville, without
fixed purpose, and found employment with a
railway surveying party. He supported himself
by engineering until he felt justified in taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
up the law, in which he was successful, and to
which he was constant until the increase of
literary reputation and steady employment in
more congenial labor made it possible for him
to abandon it. His marriage to a daughter of
John Lee, an influential citizen of the county,
fixed him as a resident of Crawfordsville, which
has since remained his home. For a number
of years he was prominent in local politics.
He sat once in the State legislature, and he was
appointed State geologist in 1885.</p>

<p>Mr. Thompson had written experimentally in
boyhood, and after his removal to Indiana he
continued the cultivation of his gifts, and beginning
slowly, attained to an abundant production,
in both prose and poetry, that made him
through many years the Western author whose
name most frequently occurred in the indices of
the best magazines. During his youth in the
Cherokee country he had been initiated into the
mysteries of archery by a hermit who lived in
the midst of a pine forest near his home. Mr.
Thompson and his brother, Will H. Thompson,
were both enthusiastic archers and hunters, and
their adventures in the wilds of Florida were full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
of romantic interest. The bow was with them
a kind of protest against the shot-gun, and
assured a less murderous extirpation of game.
Their own skill with the primitive weapon was
remarkable, and as a recurrence of interest in
the bow in this country is not imminent, they
may be considered the last of American archers.
Proficiency in this sport and the acquaintance
with woodcraft to which it led were important
influences in Mr. Thompson&#8217;s first literary
work. In the seventies, a great revival in
archery swept the country, and this was wholly
due to a series of articles on archery and on
hunting with the long bow which Mr. Thompson
printed in the periodicals. These papers
were gathered into a book (1878), and although
he had published three years before a volume
of sketches called &#8220;Hoosier Mosaics,&#8221; his
writings on this subject, with the attractive
title &#8220;The Witchery of Archery,&#8221; gave him his
first footing as an author. The long bow has
again fallen into disuse, but the freshness and
zest of those sketches have not passed away.
However, the archer had found in his woodlands
more important material than he had yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
made use of; for while he was following Robin
Hood, he was also the servant of Theocritus
and Meleager, and he wrote at this period many
lyrics that suggested, by their spirit at least,
the Greek pastoral poetry more than anything in
English. They were published under the descriptive
title &#8220;Songs of Fair Weather&#8221; (1883),
and are included also in a larger volume of
Mr. Thompson&#8217;s verse, &#8220;Poems&#8221; (1892). E.
S. Nadal writes<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> that he has never known any
scenery so classical as the glades which border
the forests of Ohio and Indiana. In fancy, he
is able to people them with figures of mythology,
and in no other spots, he says, has his imagination
been equal to this task. It is pleasant to
find this comment running into a reference to
Mr. Thompson: &#8220;When I was the literary
reviewer of a New York daily,&#8221; says Mr. Nadal,
&#8220;I was always on the lookout for the verses
of a young poet who lived in this part of the
world. I remember that one of his poems
related how that once when Diana was at her
bath in some clear spring, no doubt known to
the poet, a sort of sublimated Hoosier of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
fancy, himself quite nude and classic, passed
near by. He quickly, however, ran away far
through the green thick groves of May,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;&#8216;Afeard lest down the wind of Spring</div>
<div class="verse">He&#8217;d hear an arrow whispering.&#8217;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>There is a great deal of the Indiana landscape
to be found through Mr. Thompson&#8217;s
poems, though he often looks southward to
the north Georgia hills and to Florida. Servile
descriptions he does not give, but against
backgrounds traced with great delicacy and
beauty he throws suddenly and for a moment
only some fleeting spirit of the woodland.
There is in his language &#8220;the continual slight
novelty&#8221; which is indispensable in poetry that
is to haunt and taunt the memory. As an instance
of his felicity a poem called &#8220;Before
Dawn&#8221; may be cited:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">&#8220;A keen, insistent hint of dawn</div>
<div class="indent">Fell from the mountain height;</div>
<div class="verse">A wan, uncertain gleam betrayed</div>
<div class="indent">The faltering of the night.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">&#8220;The emphasis of silence made</div>
<div class="indent">The fog above the brook</div>
<div class="verse">Intensely pale; the trees took on</div>
<div class="indent">A haunted, haggard look.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
<div class="first">&#8220;Such quiet came, expectancy</div>
<div class="indent">Filled all the earth and sky:</div>
<div class="verse">Time seemed to pause a little space;</div>
<div class="indent">I heard a dream go by!&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Such subjects he always handles finely, leaving
the thought in a spell of mild wonder and
awe, as if something beautiful had passed and
vanished. Similar effects were often possible
with him in his younger days; and it is a
question whether the moods from which such
work proceeds recur after youth, the dream,
has departed and taken that from the heart
which &#8220;never comes again.&#8221; Those early
pieces could not have been written by an indoors
man; there is a refreshing quality of
the open air in every line of them. The note
is unusual, and is perhaps best sounded rarely;
lightness and deftness are necessary to him
who would evoke its entire purity and melody.
In &#8220;The Death of the White Heron,&#8221; &#8220;A
Flight Shot,&#8221; &#8220;Diana,&#8221; &#8220;The Fawn,&#8221; and &#8220;In
the Haunts of Bass and Bream,&#8221; he trusted
his fortunes to rhymed couplets of eight syllables,
which are particularly well adapted to
his purposes. The last-named poem relates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
with tantalizing deliberation the taking of a
bass; the life of the stream pending the capture
is described in musical, transitional passages
to the refrain,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Bubble, bubble, flows the stream,</div>
<div class="verse">Like low music through a dream.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>He again employs couplets in one of the
most appealing of all this series, &#8220;In Exile,&#8221;
which is the prayer of an archer of the new
world that England, the mother of archers,
will call him home. Later Mr. Thompson
essayed a number of poems in a flexible ode
form, showing a broadening of his powers and
a widening of his personal horizons. The
flight in such pieces as &#8220;In Captivity&#8221; and
&#8220;Before Sunrise&#8221; is longer than in the earlier
poems. It is a pleasure to find a poet
to whom America is so satisfactory as a field
that he dares to set up the mocking-bird
against the nightingale. Mr. Thompson makes
the home-songster a medium for communicating
the spirit and significance of our democracy to
our friends overseas. The movement through
all these poems is free and vigorous, and the
irregular lines please by the happy chance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
the rhymes. The pleasant winds of which the
poet writes so refreshingly creep often into his
measures. Patriotic subjects he touches with
nobility and fervor; and he became the laureate
of reconstruction when he penned his
ringing poem &#8220;To the South,&#8221; the conclusion
of which must not be omitted here:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;I am a Southerner;</div>
<div class="verse">I love the South; I dared for her</div>
<div class="verse">To fight from Lookout to the Sea,</div>
<div class="verse">With her proud banner over me.</div>
<div class="verse">But from my lips thanksgiving broke</div>
<div class="verse">As God in battle thunder spoke,</div>
<div class="verse">And that Black Idol, breeding drouth</div>
<div class="verse">And dearth of human sympathy</div>
<div class="verse">Throughout the sweet and sensuous South,</div>
<div class="verse">Was, with its chains and human yoke,</div>
<div class="verse">Blown hellward from the cannon&#8217;s mouth,</div>
<div class="verse">While Freedom cheered behind the smoke!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Again, when invited to read a poem before
the Phi Beta Kappa, of Harvard, in 1893, he
chose for his subject &#8220;Lincoln&#8217;s Grave,&#8221; expressing,
with greater care, similar feelings of
loyalty, and recounting Lincoln&#8217;s high qualities
with eloquent appreciation.</p>

<p>Mr. Thompson has published a number of
novels: &#8220;A Tallahassee Girl&#8221; (1882); &#8220;His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
Second Campaign&#8221; (1882); &#8220;At Love&#8217;s Extremes&#8221;
(1885); &#8220;A Banker of Bankersville&#8221;
(1886); &#8220;A Fortnight of Folly&#8221; (1888); and
&#8220;Stories of the Cherokee Hills&#8221; (1899), a
volume of short tales reminiscent of slave days
and the author&#8217;s boyhood. &#8220;A Tallahassee
Girl&#8221; is a graceful and pretty story, the scene of
which is laid at the South, as is true also of the
two tales that immediately followed it. They
convey distinct impressions of phases of Southern
life in the early post-bellum period, and
abound in romantic color. &#8220;Alice of Old Vincennes&#8221;
(1900), is a captivating tale of the
French period of Indiana history, closing with
the surrender of Vincennes to Clark. The
heroine is delightful, and Father Beret is a
character worthy of Dumas. The book shows
in all ways a marked advance over any previous
prose work of this author. He has also written
&#8220;The Boys&#8217; Book of Sports&#8221; (1886); and
&#8220;Louisiana&#8221; (1888), in the Stories of the States
series, and &#8220;The Ocala Boy&#8221; (1885), all for
juvenile readers. He has written many essays
in which some phase of literature has been
observed from the point of view of a nature-lover;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
and his touch in such instances is
always light and his matter bright and stimulating.
Two volumes of such papers have
been collected, &#8220;By-ways and Bird Notes&#8221;
(1885) and &#8220;Sylvan Secrets&#8221; (1887). The
scientist and the litterateur meet in his discussions
of the mind and memory of birds, and
the anatomy of bird-song; and his essay on
Shakespeare, written within sound of the Gulf
of Mexico, to the accompaniment of the songs
of mocking-birds, is wholly characteristic of
his independence in literary matters. He has
been one of the most courageous champions
of the romantic as against the analytic and
realistic. He delivered at the Hartford Theological
Seminary, in 1883, a series of lectures
dealing comprehensively with the question of
morality in literature, and he embodied these
in a volume, &#8220;The Ethics of Literary Art&#8221;
(1883). Mr. Thompson became, in 1889, literary
editor of the New York <i>Independent</i>, reserving,
however, the privilege of continuing
his residence at Crawfordsville. His home,
&#8220;Sherwood Place,&#8221; is on a quiet margin
of the town, and the house has stood for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
half a century shielded from the public eye
by native beeches and alien pines. Mr.
Thompson&#8217;s life is wholly devoted to study
and writing. His instincts are thoroughly
scholarly, and in some directions, as in Greek
poetry and Old French literature, where long
and loving study have given him special knowledge,
he is an authority. He has no complaints
of the world&#8217;s treatment of him or his
work, and he declares that his writings have
been received with much more cordiality than
they have deserved. He is exceedingly kind
to beginners in literature, and his criticisms
have been of benefit to many young Western
and Southern writers. Wabash College conferred
upon him, in 1900, the degree of Doctor
of Letters.</p>

<p>His brother, Will H. Thompson, was born
in Missouri (1846), and the experiences of their
youth and early manhood were similar. Will
Thompson was a marvellous archer, and shared
his brother&#8217;s enthusiasm for hunting with
bow and arrow. He has not been, in recent
years, a resident of Crawfordsville, having
removed to the State of Washington, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
he wrote while in Indiana his &#8220;High Tide at
Gettysburg,&#8221; one of the few poems of the Civil
War that has adequately expressed the spirit of
battle and the larger meaning of the conflict.</p>


<h3>III. <i>Mary H. Krout</i>&mdash;<i>Caroline V. Krout</i></h3>

<p>Mary H. Krout, another Crawfordsville
author, has added to the distinction of an
Indiana family in which an admiral, George
Brown, and several scholars and scientists
have appeared. In her girlhood she wrote the
verses &#8220;Little Brown Hands,&#8221; which have enjoyed
a vitality not always relished by the
author, whose later and longer flights are better
deserving of recognition. Miss Krout has
been an indefatigable traveller, and her books
include &#8220;Hawaii and a Revolution&#8221; (1898), an
account of her personal experiences in the
Sandwich Islands during the political crisis
that preceded annexation; also &#8220;A Looker-on
in London&#8221; (1899), which describes novel
phases of English life freshly. Miss Krout
more recently penetrated to the interior of
China, visiting cities remote from the beaten
track of travel. Her sister, Caroline V. Krout,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
a classical scholar of high attainment, has
written, under the nom de plume &#8220;Caroline
Brown,&#8221; &#8220;Knights in Fustian&#8221; (1900), a novel
of Indiana. The &#8220;knights in fustian&#8221; are
&#8220;Knights of the Golden Circle,&#8221; a treasonable
society which menaced Indiana during the Civil
War. The principal characters are the fatuous
rustics, who indulge their crude taste for the
mysterious in the secret meetings and sonorous
ritual of the society. Miss Krout knows the
people of her own soil thoroughly, and the
particular type that has attracted her is set
out in her pages with photographic accuracy.
The tale is true to history and to the local
life, and its literary excellence places the
author&#8217;s name high on the roll of Western
writers. She has also written many short
stories for the periodicals.</p>

<small>&#8220;OF MAKING MANY BOOKS THERE IS NO END&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> multiplication of books by Indianians
increased steadily during the last decade of the
nineteenth century. Much of the production
in prose is unimportant save as it is taken in
connection with the general rise of cultivation
in the State, and not a little derives interest
principally from the personality of the writers.
Fiction attracted many during the period indicated,
and the impulse in this direction has been
attended with notable successes. The part
played by Indiana in the Civil War has latterly
received attention, and the newer phases of village
life have also been treated. Local history
has not, unfortunately, attracted the literary
fledgling in Indiana so often as could have been
desired, though the field is inviting, and thorough
work of this kind is far likelier to enjoy permanency
than fair or indifferent fiction or mediocre
verse. Criticism is naturally last to receive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
attention, and little critical writing can be credited
to the State. It is, however, remarkable
that so much good work is done in the several
departments, the inference being that where so
many are moved to make experiments, the general
average of cultivation must be high.</p>

<p>Indiana has been a kind of way station for
many who have gained their chief distinction elsewhere.
Joaquin Miller and John James Piatt
were born in Indiana, but left in childhood, and
Mary Hartwell Catherwood lived in the State
for a number of years; but these writers may
hardly be numbered among Indiana authors.
James Newton Matthews, an Indianian who
has lived for many years in Illinois, has written
much good verse, and is included in discriminating
anthologies. Lyman Abbott began his
ministry in Indiana as pastor of the Congregational
Church at Terre Haute. Both Charles
Warren Stoddard and Maurice Francis Egan
were members of the faculty of Notre Dame
University at different periods. The Rev. Arthur
Wentworth Eaton, a poet and writer on
Acadian life, was once a resident of Indianapolis;
and Henry F. Keenan, who wrote &#8220;Trajan&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
and other novels, edited the Indianapolis
<i>Sentinel</i> before he became an author. The Rev.
Bernard Harrison Nadal (1812-1870) held a
professorship at Asbury University from 1854
to 1857, and was the father of E. S. Nadal, an
essayist whose critical papers appeal to the
admirers of a calm and pensive style of writing.
Miss Lucy S. Furman&#8217;s &#8220;Stories of a Sanctified
Town&#8221; (1896) were written at Evansville,
though the scenes are laid in Kentucky. The
Rev. James Cooley Fletcher, of the well-known
Indiana family of that name, is the author of
&#8220;Brazil and Brazilians&#8221; (1868); and his daughter,
Julia Constance, wrote, under the pen-name
&#8220;George Fleming,&#8221; the novels &#8220;Kismet&#8221;
(1877); &#8220;Mirage&#8221; (1878); &#8220;The Head of
Medusa&#8221; (1880); &#8220;Vestigia&#8221; (1884); and &#8220;Andromeda&#8221;
(1885). Both have long been absent
from the State, Mr. Fletcher in California and
his daughter in Italy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span></p>


<h3>I. <i>Fiction</i></h3>

<p>Booth Tarkington stands with Mr. Riley as
the exponent of a Hoosier who is kindly, generous,
humorous, and essentially domestic. His
novel, &#8220;A Gentleman from Indiana&#8221; (1899),
depicts the semi-urban type that Mr. Riley so
often celebrates in verse. Whitecapping as introduced
in this story is only the coarse exploit
of a vicious colony living on the outskirts of the
town in which Mr. Tarkington&#8217;s tale has its
habitation. The author plainly states that his
whitecaps are not to be confounded with vigilance
committees that undertake to reform the
morals of individuals, but that they are rowdies
who masquerade as whitecaps merely for purposes
of private mischief and vengeance. Their
settlement resembles in some degree the &#8220;tough
neighborhood&#8221; often found in cities. The hostility
between the people of Plattville and the
Cross Roads element dates back to the first
movement of population on the long trail from
North Carolina into the Ohio Valley. The Cross
Roads folk had been evil and worthless in their
early homes, and they carried their worst traits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
with them into Indiana. Mr. Tarkington has
followed accurately the social history of the
good stock and the bad, illustrating the antipathy
existing between the prosperous and intelligent
and the idle and ignorant. The distinction
of Plattville as a county seat of the central
West is well established, and its indolence,
amiability, and pride are characteristic. The
hero is a new type of Hoosier, who has little
kinship with the earlier people of Eggleston, or
with the Hoosier as Riley reports him; he is a
native, but has experienced at an Eastern college
an intellectual change &#8220;into something rich
and strange,&#8221; and after long absence becomes
a pilgrim of light among his own people.</p>

<p>Mr. Tarkington has a perfect appreciation of
the strength of local affection in the Hoosier,
and also of the thoroughly American absorption
in politics which seems to be more marked
in county seats of a few thousand inhabitants
than in large cities. History in towns like
Plattville is not dated, <i>anno urbis condit&aelig;</i>, but
from a political incident or the visit of a
President; and a national campaign is a quadrennial
blessing that renews in the obscurest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
inhabitant the sense of his individual responsibility
to the government. Mr. Tarkington
emphasizes the homogeneity of the Middle
Western folk; and this is warranted fully by
the statisticians. The people of his town live
together like a great, kind family, who are sufficient
unto themselves. He has thrown into
the story the sincerity, affection, and loyalty
that are their attributes; and he adds, moreover,
the atmosphere of the Indiana landscape,
with a nice appreciation of its loveliness,
sometimes hinted and often charmingly expressed.
There is a crisp, bracing quality in
the writing that fitly accompanies the story,
which is, taken all in all, one of the most
creditable novels yet written of life in the
Ohio Valley. There is every reason why
Mr. Tarkington should know his Indiana well,
as his family has been prominent in the State
for three generations, and he is a native, having
been born at Indianapolis (1869). He
was educated at Purdue and Princeton, receiving
from the latter the degree of A.M. in
1898. He has also written (1900) &#8220;Monsieur
Beaucaire,&#8221; a dramatic novelette of the eighteenth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
century, in which a few striking incidents
are handled most effectively. The story has
the charm of an exquisite miniature.</p>

<p>Indiana village life has been made the subject
of careful study by Anna Nicholas, in a
series of short stories collected under the title
&#8220;An Idyl of the Wabash&#8221; (1899). Religious
phenomena have greatly attracted Miss Nicholas,
and she has supplemented Dr. Eggleston&#8217;s
studies of an earlier period with her
artistic sketches of contemporary life. The
social importance of the church, the vagaries
of belief in a typical Western village, and the
intensity of the &#8220;revival&#8221; spirit are treated
with sympathy and humor. Several of these
tales are, between the lines, a tribute to that
vigorous Protestant evangelization of Indiana,
which triumphed over mud and malaria and
carried the gospel far beyond the sound of
church bells. Miss Nicholas has written with
keen penetration of the suppressed tragic
element in rural life, but without morbidity.
Her characters are always inevitably related
to the incidents, and she communicates with
unfailing success a sense of the humble atmosphere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
of her farm and village. These stories
are distinguished by the evident sincerity of
their purpose to reflect life honestly, and they
are written in a straightforward manner that
aids the impression. They illustrate anew the
possibilities of a local literature that follows
progressively the formative years of a community&#8217;s
life. It is even now difficult to persuade
the present generations of Indianians
that Dr. Eggleston&#8217;s Hoosiers ever lived; and
Miss Nicholas, Mr. Riley, and Mr. Tarkington
have continued the story that was begun by
their predecessor, adding chapters equally instructive
and valuable.</p>

<p>Mary Jameson Judah&#8217;s &#8220;Down Our Way&#8221;
(1897) is not limited to a particular region, but
combines with studies of the author&#8217;s own
Indiana, sketches of social life at the South.
The allurements of those organizations for
individual improvement and general reform
that have enlisted the energies of so many
women in recent years have appealed to Mrs.
Judah&#8217;s sense of humor; and her stories show
a fine appreciation of the niceties of social
perspective and proportion in Southern and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
Western cities. The short story is happily
adapted to the need of the casual observer of
local life, and tales like these, which bear the
stamp of fidelity, have an inestimable value for
future students.</p>

<p>An increasing attention to local historical
matters has lately been marked, and an excellent
instance of this is afforded by Millard
Cox (&#8220;Henry Scott Clark&#8221;) in &#8220;The Legionaries&#8221;
(1899), a story of the Morgan raid
into Indiana. The political and social conditions
on the Indiana-Kentucky border during
the Civil War were interesting, and worthy
of the study that has been given to them in
this novel. The military episode of which
Morgan was the chief figure, though slight
in comparison with the larger movements of
the war, was dramatic and daring, and it lends
itself well to this romantic setting. Mr. Cox
is a native Indianian (1856).</p>

<p>James A. Wickersham, an Indiana educator,
has analyzed certain religious conditions
minutely in &#8220;Enoch Willoughby&#8221; (1900).
This is a novel of character rather than of
incident, and marks still another departure in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
method among writers of the Indiana group.
The tale is not wholly indigenous, as the characters
belong as truly to one State as to another
of the Middle West. The Willoughbys are
studied as a family in which peculiarities
have always been observed, and in Enoch
an hereditary &#8220;queerness&#8221; is manifested in
religious idiosyncrasies.</p>

<p>The revival of interest in romantic fiction,
that marked the closing years of the century,
witnessed the unusual successes of a number
of novels by American authors. One of the
most popular romances of this period is &#8220;When
Knighthood was in Flower&#8221; (1898), by Charles
Major, a native of Indianapolis (1856), who is
living at Shelbyville, twenty miles distant from
the capital. Mr. Major served no apprenticeship
as an author; this romance was his first
book. He was educated in the Indiana public
schools and at the University of Michigan,
and was actively engaged in the practice of
law when he wrote the novel, as a diversion, on
his Sunday afternoons at home. The friendliness
of the English-reading public to this tale
is not difficult to understand. It is a love story<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
whose chief characters, Charles Brandon and
Mary Tudor, possess those qualities of youth,
vivacity, and spirit that so inevitably win the
heart in fiction or the drama. The tale is
told by Sir Edwin Caskoden, a master of the
dance at the court of Henry VIII., and not by
the author direct,&mdash;a familiar trick of the historical
novelist; and it serves an excellent purpose,
affording a valid excuse for the ostensible
editor to render the sixteenth-century narrative
of Caskoden into racy nineteenth-century
English. This novel is one of the noteworthy
achievements of Indianians in the field of
romance, suggesting again what has been so
true of General Wallace,&mdash;that the imagination
is superior to all laws, and that the romantic
vision easily pierces barriers of circumstance.</p>

<p>George Cary Eggleston, a brother of Edward,
was born at Vevay (1839), received his preliminary
education in the schools of Vevay and
Madison, and attended Asbury University, but
did not complete his course there. When still
under seventeen he took charge of a school in
a wild district of the State, but at the end of
his engagement he went to Virginia to the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
homestead of his father&#8217;s family, completed his
college course, studied law, and served in the
Confederate army. He has for many years
been a well-known New York journalist, and he
is the author of many books. He has always
maintained relations with his native State, and
has utilized his knowledge of it in his writings.
In his novel &#8220;A Man of Honor&#8221; (1873), the
hero is an Indiana boy, the son of a Kentucky
mother and a Virginia father, as was the case
with Mr. Eggleston himself. Another novel,
&#8220;Juggernaut&#8221; (1891), opens in Indiana. A
Hoosier boy is the hero, and the description of
his early life among the hills of southern Indiana
is pleasantly reminiscent of the author&#8217;s
own experiences. In a number of juvenile
stories, among them being &#8220;The Last of the
Flat-boats&#8221; (1900), Mr. Eggleston has drawn
upon his recollections of Hoosierdom, and there
is, he says, something of Indiana in everything
that he has written. Before Mr. Eggleston had
seriously begun literary work the name of his
brother Edward was so identified with Hoosier
soil that the younger man could hardly invade
it with literary intent without risking the charge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
of imitation; yet it is significant of the tenacity
of his early impressions that throughout his
life the scenes of his childhood and youth have
continued to invite his imagination.</p>


<h3>II. <i>History and Politics</i></h3>

<p>It is a pleasure to include George W. Julian
(1817-1899) among those who have added lustre
to Indiana&#8217;s name. He was born at Centerville,
Wayne County, of Quaker parents who
had followed the familiar line of march from
North Carolina to Indiana. He worked in the
fields, studied by the light of the fireplace, taught
school, read law, and in general experienced those
vicissitudes and embarrassments that beset so
many ambitious American youths of his generation.
The law was a stepping-stone to politics,
and from 1840 until the last years of his long
life he was constantly an eager observer of
political movements when not an active participant
in campaigns. He was a founder and
leader of the Free-soil party, and was its candidate
for the vice-presidency on the ticket headed
by John P. Hale in 1852. He was repeatedly
elected a representative in Congress, first as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
Free-soil candidate, and thereafter as a Republican,
from what was known as &#8220;the burnt district&#8221;
in eastern Indiana, serving through the
Civil War. He was a vigorous opponent of
slavery, and his &#8220;Speeches on Political Subjects&#8221;
(1872), for which Lydia Maria Child wrote an
introduction, is a record of his radical opposition
that began in 1850 and continued to the
close of the rebellion. His integrity of opinion
was unimpeachable. He was a laborious student,
and, although without the graces of oratory, he
was an impressive and effective speaker. He
shared the ignominy that was visited upon Lovejoy,
Phillips, Giddings, and others of the early
antislavery phalanx, and his Congressional campaigns
were marked by bitter and violent abuse
from his opponents. His powers of invective
made him a formidable antagonist. When
his severity was criticised, he would say that
&#8220;there is nothing in my speech but the truth
that hurts.&#8221; He was essentially a reformer and
an independent, and broke fearlessly with his
party when he could not conscientiously follow
it. Thus he joined in the Liberal Republican
movement, and supported Greeley. He then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
became, and remained to the end of his life, a
Democrat, and was appointed by Mr. Cleveland
surveyor-general of New Mexico. He made
his home for thirty years at Irvington, a suburb
of Indianapolis and the seat of Butler College,
where he was the village Nestor. He delighted
in literature, lived among books, contributed
often to the periodical press, and wrote (1892)
the &#8220;Life of Joshua R. Giddings.&#8221;</p>

<p>Civic interests have marked also the career
of William Dudley Foulke, who was born in
New York City (1848) and educated at Columbia
College, being graduated in 1869. Mr.
Foulke&#8217;s antecedents were Quakers, and he
removed, in 1876, to Wayne County, one of the
principal centres of the Society of Friends
in Indiana. Mr. Foulke practised law and sat
in the State senate (1883-1885) as a Republican,
but became an independent upon the
nomination of Mr. Blaine, and thereafter gave
his attention to various political reforms, notably
in the civil service, conducting investigations
and frequently delivering addresses. He
published (1887) &#8220;Slav and Saxon,&#8221; an essay
on the future of the two races which are,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
in his belief, to contend finally for supremacy
in the world. He gave many years to
the study of the war period in Indiana, with
a view to writing the life of Oliver P. Morton,
Indiana&#8217;s &#8220;War Governor,&#8221; who had been a
citizen of Wayne County; and this biography
(1899) is not only a thorough study of Morton&#8217;s
public services, but of the period to
which he belonged as well.</p>

<p>Early associated with Mr. Foulke in civil
service reform work in Indiana was Oliver T.
Morton (1860-1898), the son of Governor Morton,
who was born in Wayne County and educated
at Yale and Oxford. His volume of
essays, &#8220;The Southern Empire&#8221; (1892), contains,
besides the title paper, an historical essay
on Oxford and an excellent discussion of
civil service reform. The opening essay is a
most suggestive presentation of the slaveholders&#8217;
ambitions to found a vast tropical slave
empire. It is of interest to read this, in the
light of the senior Morton&#8217;s herculean efforts
against slavery; but that one generation may
easily differ from another is proved by the
concluding essay in advocacy of the merit system,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
which found few friends in the period
of which Senator Morton was a dominating
figure.</p>

<p>Mr. Foulke&#8217;s brother-in-law, Arthur Middleton
Reeves (1856-1891), found employment
for his scholarly tastes in unusual channels.
After his graduation from Cornell (1878), he
devoted himself to the study of Icelandic language
and lore, in which his interest had been
aroused by Professor Willard Fiske; and he
subsequently continued his studies abroad in
Europe and Iceland. He was an industrious
and painstaking student, with a passion for
accuracy, and the volume of his letters collected
and published for his friends shows
him to have possessed unusually varied talents.
He wrote &#8220;The Finding of Wineland
the Good: The History of the Icelandic Discovery
of America&#8221; (1890); &#8220;Lad and Lass:
Story of Life in Iceland&#8221; (1890); &#8220;Jan: A Short
Story&#8221; (1892); and he had begun, with Dr.
Valtyr Gudmundsson of Copenhagen, a translation
of the <i>Laxd&aelig;la Saga</i> when, on the
occasion of a visit to his home in Indiana,
he was killed in a railway accident.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>The first Indiana historian was John B.
Dillon, who was born at Wellsburg, West Virginia
(1808), learned the printer&#8217;s trade, and
removed to Indiana in 1834. While resident
at Logansport he studied law and was
admitted to the bar; but his quiet, studious
habits and natural reserve unfitted him for
the practice, and he never tested his powers.
He turned, fortunately, to the study of Indiana&#8217;s
history; and appreciating the importance
of assembling data before the death of witnesses
and participants, began collecting material,
and published (1859) a &#8220;History of
Indiana,&#8221; covering the period from the first
explorations to 1856. This work represents
many years of laborious research in a field
that was practically untouched. It is the
point of departure for all who study Indiana
history, and it is as exact as diligent care
could make it. Dillon published &#8220;Notes on
Historical Evidence in Reference to Adverse
Theories of the Origin and Nature of the
Government of the United States&#8221; (1871); and
at his death left the manuscript of a work
called &#8220;Oddities of Colonial Legislation.&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
He received a number of minor appointments
under the Federal government, residing at
Washington from 1863 to 1875. He returned
to Indianapolis at the termination of these
employments and died there, in 1879. He
was gentle, patient, modest, and industrious,
a man of merit, faithful in all things. He
never married, and had no interests save those
of the student. His proper place was in the
quiet alcoves of libraries; and it must always
be remembered to his credit that with little
encouragement, and for the love of the labor,
rather than for any reward, he gave many
laborious years to the task of establishing
the State&#8217;s place in history.</p>

<p>Jacob P. Dunn, who wrote &#8220;Indiana: A
Redemption from Slavery,&#8221; in the American
Commonwealth series (1888), employed critical
methods that were not known in Dillon&#8217;s
day. His work deals with a brief period, and
with events that had not previously been
viewed in their proper perspective. He brought
to bear upon his subject a scientific analysis
and an exhaustive research that show especial
fitness for historical writing. His descriptions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
of the early French <i>habitant</i> are delightfully
written, and give a distinct impression of
the first white settlers of the Wabash. Mr.
Dunn has written also &#8220;Massacres of the
Mountains&#8221; (1886), an account of the Indian
wars of the West, which is noteworthy for
its thorough treatment of the Mountain
Meadows incident. It is a standard work
of reference, and one of the most popular
books catalogued in Western libraries. Mr.
Dunn served a term as State librarian, and
has been for many years tireless in promoting
interest in libraries for rural communities.
He was born at Lawrenceburg (1855),
and was graduated (1874) from Earlham College.</p>

<p>John Clark Ridpath (1840-1900), one of the
most prolific of Indiana authors, was born in
Putnam County and was graduated from Asbury
University, with which he was subsequently
connected in various teaching and administrative
capacities for many years. He was a
most successful teacher, particularly of history.
Besides many text-books he published &#8220;A
Cyclop&aelig;dia of Universal History&#8221; (1885);<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
&#8220;Great Races of Mankind&#8221; (1894); &#8220;Life
and Memoirs of Bishop William Taylor&#8221;
(1895); and many monographs on historical
and biographical subjects.</p>

<p>Richard G. Boone&#8217;s &#8220;History of Education
in Indiana&#8221; (1892) is one of the most important
books in the State&#8217;s bibliography. Mr.
Boone is also the author of &#8220;Education in the
United States&#8221; (1894). He was for ten years
identified with the common schools of Indiana,
and for seven years held the chair of pedagogics
at Indiana University, resigning to
become superintendent of schools at Cincinnati.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Puritan Republic&#8221; (1899), by Daniel
Wait Howe, shows further the grasp of newer
methods in historical writing, and is distinguished
by thorough treatment and judicial
temper. It would seem that nothing could
be added to the literature of this subject,
which has attracted so many skilled historians;
but Judge Howe adduced much new
material and presented the old and familiar
in an orderly and attractive manner. This is
a thorough and exact work, which has taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
rank with the accepted authorities. Judge
Howe is entitled to his word on the Puritan,
as his ancestors were among the pioneers
of Sudbury, Massachusetts. He was born
in Switzerland County (1839), was graduated
from Franklin College, served four years in
the Civil War as an Indiana soldier, and
enjoyed the unusual distinction of sitting for
fourteen years continuously as a judge of the
Superior Court at Indianapolis. He has contributed
valuable essays to the publications
of the Indiana Historical Society.</p>

<p>William H. English (1822-1896) gave many
years to a study of the life and services of
George Rogers Clark, and produced (1896)
&#8220;Conquest of the Country Northwest of the
River Ohio, and Life of George Rogers Clark,&#8221;
an elaborate work in two volumes, which is a
veritable encyclop&aelig;dia of facts. As Clark had
been one of the neglected figures in American
history, the preparation of his biography was
in the nature of a public service. Mr. English
is also the author of an historical and biographical
work on the Indiana constitution. He was
born in Scott County, and received his education<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
in the public schools and at Hanover
College. He served as a representative in
Congress (1853-1861), and in 1880 was the
Democratic candidate for vice-president on
the ticket with Hancock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Early Indiana Trials and Sketches&#8221; (1858)
is a racy record of the personal experiences of
Oliver H. Smith (1794-1859), who had a kind
of Boswellian instinct for the interesting. As a
lawyer he &#8220;rode circuit&#8221; with Miles Eggleston,
David Wallace, James Rariden, John Test, and
others famous in the early days; and no one
has written of these men with nicer appreciation
of their high qualities. He was elected a
senator in Congress in 1836, and served for one
term.</p>

<p>William Wesley Woollen (1828) has also
added to the literature of local biography.
His &#8220;Biographical and Historical Sketches of
Early Indiana&#8221; (1883) contains information
that is nowhere else accessible, and it is, moreover,
a well-written and entertaining volume.</p>

<p>David Demaree Banta (1833-1896) wrote
often and well on subjects of local history, and
his &#8220;Historical Sketch of Johnson County&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
(1881) shines amid the dreary waste of Indiana
County histories. It contains a rare fund of
information touching pioneer life in general,
and reflects in some degree the personality of
the accomplished and versatile author, who was
a fine type of the native Hoosier.</p>


<h3>III. <i>Miscellaneous</i></h3>

<p>The press of Indiana has aided greatly in the
State&#8217;s intellectual advance. In the larger
towns the newspapers have usually been well-written,
and many of them have extended sympathetic
encouragement to beginners in authorship.
Many Western writers found their first
friendly editors at the offices of the <i>Herald</i> or
<i>Journal</i> at Indianapolis. John H. Holliday, G.
C. Matthews, Anna Nicholas, Elijah W. Halford,
Charles Richard Williams, A. H. Dooley, Lewis
D. Hayes, Morris Ross and Louis Howland are
among those who, in the hurried labors of
daily newspaper-making, have found time to
preach the gospel of &#8220;sweetness and light&#8221;
through the Indianapolis press. High on the
roll of Indiana journalists whose talents are
especially deserving of remembrance is Berry R.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
Sulgrove (1827-1890), who was born at Indianapolis,
attended local schools, learned the saddler&#8217;s
trade, and worked for a short time as a
journeyman. His aptness and love of learning
had attracted attention, and in 1847 he was
enabled to enter Bethany College, West Virginia,
then under the presidency of the famous
Alexander Campbell. His preparatory studies
at the &#8220;Old Seminary&#8221; of Indianapolis had
been so thorough that he was graduated at the
end of one year with all the honors of the college,
and delivered his commencement oration
in Greek. He studied law and practised for
a few years, but became connected with the
<i>Journal</i> in 1854, and was thereafter identified
with the press of Indianapolis. He possessed
an extraordinary memory that was a source of
constant amazement to his friends and associates.
His information in many departments of
knowledge was both extensive and exact, and
he retained, to the end of his life, his interest
in public matters, foreign and domestic. He
wrote with precision and grace, and his use of
homely, local illustrations added to the interest
and force of what he had to say. Now and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
then a Macaulay-like roll would sound in his
sentences; and he would frequently imitate
Macaulay&#8217;s rhetorical tricks, as by declaring,
with conscious humor, that some local event
had &#8220;never been equalled between the old
bridge and the bayou&#8221;; but he wrote usually
without affectation, and his prodigious memory
made possible a variety of suggestion and illustration
that never failed to distinguish his work.
During many years he was at different times
a contributor of editorial matter to all of the
Indianapolis newspapers, extending his field at
intervals to the Chicago and Cincinnati dailies.
He wrote usually at his home, and latterly had
no desk in any newspaper office, though a
member of the <i>News</i> staff to the end of his
life. His manuscript was famous among Western
printers, who encountered it at Cincinnati,
Indianapolis, and Chicago, and in the day of
Mr. Sulgrove&#8217;s greatest activity seemed unable
to escape from it. He wrote habitually on the
backs of old election tickets, on scraps of programmes,
on bits of paper picked up on his
country walks, but never by any chance on a
clean new sheet designed for the purpose.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
His handwriting was microscopic, but perfectly
legible, carefully punctuated, and free from
erasure. A slip the length and breadth of the
hand might contain half a column. No more
interesting figure than he ever appeared in
Indiana journalism; but his ambitions were not
equal to his talents, and he was long an obscure
figure in the city of his birth, whose intimate
history he knew familiarly. His &#8220;History of
Indianapolis and Marion County&#8221; (1884) contains
only slight hints of his superior abilities.</p>

<p>His contemporary, George C. Harding (1829-1881),
was a native of Tennessee, but gave the
best years of his life to journalism at Indianapolis.
He was a student of human nature rather
than of books, but his literary instincts were
true, and in the two weekly newspapers, the
<i>Herald</i> and the <i>Review</i>, which he conducted,
he was at once the inspiration and the terror of
his contributors. Some of the sketches in a
volume of his &#8220;Miscellaneous Writings&#8221; (1882)
show an agreeably humorous turn. He had the
trained journalist&#8217;s appreciation of condensed
wisdom. It was his habit to repeat, week after
week, a satirical paragraph in which some individual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
was pilloried until the victim&#8217;s name
became a by-word and a hissing in the community.
Sometimes this served a moral purpose;
again the intention was purely humorous.
Years ago a candidate for constable, who was
also a delegate to the nominating convention
held at Indianapolis, received therein exactly
one vote. The question, &#8220;Who voted for Daubenspeck?&#8221;
was thereupon reiterated weekly in
the <i>Herald</i>, until it passed permanently into a
phrase of local speech.</p>

<p>Angelina Teal&#8217;s &#8220;John Thorne&#8217;s Folks&#8221;
(1884), and &#8220;Muriel Howe&#8221; (1892); Margaret
Holmes&#8217;s &#8220;Chamber Over the Gate&#8221; (1886);
Martha Livingstone Moody&#8217;s &#8220;Alan Thorne&#8221;
(1889); Harriet Newell Lodge&#8217;s &#8220;A Bit of
Finesse&#8221; (1894); many excellent short stories
by Helen Rockwood Edson, literary essays by
Harriet Noble and Kate Milner Rabb, and Ida
Husted Harper&#8217;s &#8220;Life and Work of Susan B.
Anthony,&#8221; emphasize the part that women have
played in the State&#8217;s literary achievement. The
Rev. Charles R. Henderson, of Lafayette, a
member of the faculty of Chicago University,
has been a prolific writer on sociological subjects.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
John Augustine Wilstach, also of Lafayette,
has busied himself with philological
studies. He translated Virgil (1884) and Dante
(1888), and coincidently with the publication of
these versions issued critical reviews of the
literature touching his subjects. The text of
Lucian was edited for school use (1882) by
Charles Richard Williams, who became an Indianapolis
journalist; and Demarchus C. Brown
translated selections of Lucian into English
(1896). George Ade, who discovered fresh subjects
for materialistic fiction in Chicago, was
born in Indiana and educated at Purdue, as was
also his illustrator, John T. McCutcheon. Mr.
Ade has a touch all his own, and his character
studies are thoroughly original. He and Hector
Fuller, another Hoosier writer of short fiction,
show how the journalist may successfully turn
his hand to book-making. William P. Fishback,
one of the founders of the Indianapolis
Literary Club, has published (1895) his &#8220;Recollections
of Lord Coleridge,&#8221; with whom he enjoyed
a delightful acquaintance; and another
member of the club, Augustus Lynch Mason,
wrote &#8220;Romance and Tragedy of Pioneer Life&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
(1883). Benjamin Harrison&#8217;s public services
cannot obscure the fact of his authorship of
&#8220;This Country of Ours&#8221; (1899), a capital account
of the functions of the several departments
of the Federal government.</p>

<p>That form of humorous writing which has
become a feature of American journalism, and
which is, moreover, a sharply critical commentary
on contemporaneous American life, not to
be rejected lightly, is also produced in great
volume in Indiana. This goes to the public
anonymously, but Emma Carleton, R. D. Stevenson
(&#8220;Wickwire&#8221;), and Wood Levette Wilson
are among those whose dialogues, paragraphs,
and jingles constantly appear in many
publications. S. W. Gillilan, who wrote &#8220;Finnigan
to Flannigan,&#8221; the verses in Irish dialect
which have become a kind of American
railway classic, is an Indianian.</p>

<small>AN INDIANA CHOIR</small></h2>
</div>

<h3>I. <i>Early Writers</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> specific talent necessary to the expression
of local life is much rarer than the ability
to write of life in the abstract. If the knack
of writing accompanied a sensibility to the life
that lay nearest, we should long ago have had
an abundant American literature descriptive of
conditions that have passed and will not, in
the very nature of things, recur. But the line
of impressionability may not be controlled; and
though many protests have been launched
against minor American poets for looking beyond
the robin to the nightingale, the rejection
of the near continues, though in a diminishing
degree. The early poets of the Ohio Valley did
not often approach closely to the Western soil;
they lacked insight and courage and their work
was usually not interesting. When they occasionally
essayed a Western subject, they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
unable to bring to bear upon it any novelty of
treatment; it was all &#8220;icily regular, splendidly
null.&#8221; William T. Coggeshall states in the
preface to his &#8220;Poets and Poetry of the West&#8221;
(1864) that in the early years of the nineteenth
century &#8220;soldiers, hunters, and boatmen
had among them many songs descriptive of
adventures incident to backwoods life, some of
which were not destitute of poetic merit; but
they were known only around campfires, or
on &#8216;broadhorns&#8217;&#8221; (flat-boats), and tradition, he
adds, preserved none worthy to be included in
his anthology. But these racy songs would
have been of greater value than much of the
verse that he has preserved in his pages,
though as a part of the history of development
this, too, is not to be spurned. Coggeshall&#8217;s
work includes notices of ninety-seven men and
fifty-five women. Twenty-three of the total
he attributes to Indiana by reason of residence,
and thirteen of the number were natives of
the State. Only a small proportion of the
poets named by Coggeshall survived, though
the writers of the biographical notes accompanying
his selections were cordial and anxious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
to confer immortality. William D. Howells and
John J. Piatt are included, and Mr. Howells
wrote several of the sketches. It is diverting
to read the opinion of Mr. Howells&#8217;s biographer
that &#8220;some of his prose sketches are quite
equal in grace of conception and individuality
of treatment to any of his poems.&#8221; He was
then twenty-seven.</p>

<p>Cincinnati and Lexington, Kentucky, were
early rivals for literary prominence at the West:
one was the seat of Cincinnati College, the
other of Transylvania University. Many books
were published at Lexington before 1825,
and <i>The Medley</i>, or <i>Monthly Miscellany</i>, which
appeared there in 1803, is believed to have
been the first magazine published west of the
Alleghanies. Hunt&#8217;s <i>Western Review</i>, which
was formerly regarded as the pioneer, dated
from 1819, and was also a Lexington publication.
Lexington dropped out, and Louisville
fell into place as a defender of the literary
faith with the advent of George D. Prentice,
who became the ardent champion of the muses
in the Ohio Valley. The headquarters of poets
for this region was the office of the Louisville<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
<i>Journal</i> during Prentice&#8217;s reign, and all
of the Coggeshall poets laid the tribute of
their song before him. To paraphrase Bishop
Butler&#8217;s remark about the strawberry, quoted
by Walton, doubtless Prentice might have declined
a poem or discouraged a poet, but
doubtless he never did. He was not an exacting
critic, and he encouraged many who were
without talent; but he took away the reproach
of the neglected and unappreciated, and now
and then he found a few grains in the chaff
to pay him for his trouble.</p>

<p>The <i>Literary Gazette</i>, which appeared at
Cincinnati in 1824, with the motto &#8220;Not to
display learning, but to excite a taste for it,&#8221;
numbered Mrs. Julia L. Dumont, of Vevay,
among its contributors; and she was the first
Indiana writer to become identified with the
group of aspirants that now began to appear
along the Ohio. The prospectus of another
<i>Western Review</i>, published at Cincinnati for
three years from May, 1827, declared that
&#8220;we are a scribbling and forthputting people.
Little as they have dreamed of the fact in
the Atlantic country, we have our thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
orators and poets.&#8221; However this may have
been, &#8220;the Atlantic country&#8221; invaded the
Ohio Valley in 1835, when the <i>Western
Messenger</i> was begun at Cincinnati, under
the auspices of the Western Unitarian Association.
It was edited first by the Rev.
Ephraim Peabody, and later, at Louisville, by
James Freeman Clarke. Clarke left Louisville
in 1840, and the <i>Messenger</i> was continued at
Cincinnati by the Rev. W. H. Channing. John
B. Dillon represented Indiana in its table of
contents, and found himself in good company,
with Emerson, William Ellery Channing, Jones
Very, and C. P. Cranch. The periodical was,
as Venable calls it, &#8220;an exotic&mdash;a Boston
flower blooming on the Ohio,&#8221; and it ceased
to appear in 1841. In the same year, the
<i>Ladies&#8217; Repository</i> made its appearance at Cincinnati,
under Methodist auspices, and was published
continuously for thirty-six years. Mrs.
Dumont, Mrs. Sarah T. Bolton, Miss Mary
Louise Chitwood, Mrs. Rebecca S. Nichols,
Mrs. A. L. Ruter Dufour, Horace P. Biddle,
and Isaac H. Julian were the principal Indiana
contributors. The number of Indiana writers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
increased steadily, and the <i>Genius of the West</i>,
a Cincinnati magazine dating from 1855, extended
the list to include the names of Benjamin
S. Parker, John B. Dillon, and Louise
E. Vickroy. Peter Fishe Reed, also a contributor
to the <i>Genius of the West</i> and similar
magazines of the period, combined farming
with literary experiments near Mount Vernon
(Indiana), and lived for a time at Indianapolis.
The majority of these pioneer periodicals lived
only a short time, and the Civil War brought
a final interruption to most of them; they
passed out with the &#8220;annuals,&#8221; whose literary
flavor was similar. Indiana&#8217;s ante-bellum writers
usually looked to Louisville and Cincinnati
for publicity, and no serious effort was made
to establish literary magazines within the State.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
It curiously happened, however, that Emerson
Bennett, a voluminous producer of &#8220;penny
dreadfuls,&#8221; published a literary paper called
the <i>Casket</i>, at Lawrenceburg (1846), but soon
abandoned it. The patient research of Venable
discovered the <i>Western Censor</i>, published<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
at Indianapolis in 1823-1824, and <i>The Family
Schoolmaster</i>, which had a brief existence at
Richmond in 1839. <i>The Querist</i> was conducted
by Mrs. Nichols for a few months at
Cincinnati in 1844, and Henry Ward Beecher&#8217;s
<i>Indiana Farmer and Gardener</i> was begun at
Indianapolis in 1845, but removed to Cincinnati
in the following year. Beecher&#8217;s contributions
to this paper were the nucleus of his
book &#8220;A Pleasant Talk about Fruits, Flowers,
and Farming.&#8221; The <i>Literary Messenger</i> is
credited to Versailles, 1854.</p>

<p>Coggeshall included among the Indianians in
his anthology William Wallace Harney, who was
born (1832) at Bloomington, where his father was
a professor in Indiana University; and William
Ross Wallace, born (1819) at Lexington, Kentucky,
and educated at Bloomington and Hanover
colleges; but as the literary life of both
began after they had left the State, they may
hardly be catalogued as Indiana authors. The
Rev. Sidney Dyer, a native of New York State
(1814), was for a number of years (1852-1859),
a Baptist minister at Indianapolis. He is the
author of a number of books, and his writings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
include many popular songs and poems. Isaac
H. Julian, a native of Wayne County (1823),
and the brother of George W. Julian, hardly
added subsequently to the reputation he had
gained prior to the publication of Coggeshall&#8217;s
book, and the same is true of Granville M.
Ballard, who was born in Kentucky (1833),
and after his graduation from Asbury University
became a resident of Indianapolis, where
he is still living. Horace P. Biddle, born in
Ohio (1818-1900), removed at an early age
to Indiana, where he became prominent in
affairs, and held many public offices before
his retirement. He aided in the early efforts
in behalf of common school education, and was
a diligent student and writer. Noble Butler
is placed in Kentucky&#8217;s list of early writers,
though his residence at Hanover gives Indiana
a claim upon him. He frequently translated
German poetry and wrote original verse occasionally;
but the fugitive essays of his nephew,
Noble C. Butler, of Indianapolis, are better literature.
Coggeshall includes also Jonathan W.
Gordon and Henry W. Ellsworth, of Indianapolis,
whose contributions to the literature of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
period were slight and without distinction.
Ellsworth was a native of Connecticut and a
graduate of Yale (1834). Amanda L. Ruter
Dufour (1822-1899) and Laura M. Thurston
(1812-1842) are properly included among Indiana&#8217;s
early poets. The latter wrote the lines
&#8220;On Crossing the Alleghanies&#8221; and &#8220;The Green
Hills of My Fatherland,&#8221; which are above the
average in the collection and were once much
applauded. George W. Cutter, whose &#8220;Song of
Steam,&#8221; beginning,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Harness me down with your iron bands;</div>
<div class="verse">Be sure of your curb and rein,&#8221;&mdash;</div>
</div></div>

<p>was once in favor, lived in Indiana, and sat in
the General Assembly. He died at Washington
in 1865. Rebecca S. Nichols was long
associated with the little band of writers who
printed verses and tales in Louisville and
Cincinnati publications, and her literary instincts
were truer than those of most of her contemporaries.
She is still living at Indianapolis.</p>

<p>A mournful interest attaches to the work of
Mary Louise Chitwood, who was born at Mount
Carmel, October 29, 1832, and died there
twenty-three years later, sincerely mourned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
by the whole choir of Western poets. Prentice
had encouraged her, and he wrote a memoir to
accompany a volume of her verses that appeared
in 1857. Her work promised well, though it
shared the defects of most of the verse of the
day.</p>

<p>Sarah T. Bolton is one of the most interesting
figures in Coggeshall, and though born in Kentucky
(1820), her long life was spent principally
in Indiana. Her husband, Nathaniel Bolton,
edited the first newspaper ever published in
Indianapolis. Mrs. Bolton began writing at an
early age, and through many years it may be
said that she stood for poetry in Indiana. Many
of her poems are stiff and formal and show little
originality; but often her pieces are free and
spontaneous, and she had humor, which most
of the early poets of the West lacked. Her
last volume (1891) is dedicated &#8220;To the poets
of Indiana, my children after the spirit.&#8221;
She was known to Willis and Morris, of the
Knickerbocker group contemporary with her.
Her husband was appointed consul at Geneva
in 1855, and she lived for a number of years
abroad, finding fresh material for poems in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
travels. She died at Indianapolis in 1893.
Her best-known poem is &#8220;Paddle Your Own
Canoe.&#8221; She was a loyal Indianian and wrote
the lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;The winds of Heaven never fanned,</div>
<div class="verse">The circling sunlight never spanned</div>
<div class="verse">The borders of a better land</div>
<div class="indent2">Than our own Indiana.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Benjamin S. Parker, of all the poets discovered
in Indiana by Coggeshall, acquired
the greatest skill in versification, and wrote
most comprehensively of the pioneer life. He
was born on a farm near New Castle (1833),
and is one, at least, to whom the phrase
&#8220;racy of the soil&#8221; needs no explanation. He
lived in a log cabin, performing the hardest
farm labor, and long observation of life at
the West made him an authority in matters
of customs and dialect. His volume &#8220;The
Cabin in the Clearing&#8221; (1887) contains many
poems in which the trials of the earlier settlers
are graphically depicted, and it was his
right, as one who had aided in the rough
work of the pioneers, to urge the new generations
to use worthily the opportunities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
which they inherited. Of the fauna and flora
of his own woodlands Mr. Parker became the
especial celebrant. The following lines from
one of his most graceful pieces are characteristic
of his happiest moods:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;I had a dream of other days,&mdash;</div>
<div class="indent">In golden luxury waved the wheat;</div>
<div class="verse">In tangled greenness shook the maize;</div>
<div class="indent">The squirrels ran with nimble feet,</div>
<div class="verse">And in and out among the trees</div>
<div class="indent">The hangbird darted like a flame;</div>
<div class="verse">The cat-bird piped his melodies,</div>
<div class="indent">Purloining every warbler&#8217;s fame:</div>
<div class="verse">And then I heard triumphal song,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Tis morning and the days are long.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Mr. Parker felt, more than any other poet
of the Ohio Valley, the grandeur of the vast
woodlands as the pioneers found them, and
he has touched upon it constantly in his writings.
He lived for several years in Canada,
as a consular officer, and wrote a series of
poems under Northern influences; but he has
been most fortunate in subjects derived from
home experiences. He is a connecting link
between the earliest Indiana writers and their
successors, and he has been one of the humblest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
and most devoted and sincere of all the
servants of literature in his State.</p>


<h3>II. <i>Forceythe Willson</i></h3>

<p>It is an abrupt transition from these pioneers
of poesy to Forceythe Willson, the only
Indiana poet who ever came in contact
with the New England group. Emerson, in
the preface to his &#8220;Parnassus&#8221; (1874), says,
&#8220;I have inserted only one of the remarkable
poems of Forceythe Willson, a young Wisconsin
poet of extraordinary promise, who died
very soon after this was written.&#8221; The poem
chosen was &#8220;In State.&#8221; This placing of Willson
in Wisconsin is, as Piatt says in his eloquent
sketch of the poet,<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> rather needless, for
he was never connected with Wisconsin in
any way. He was born at Genesee Falls,
New York, April 10, 1837. In 1846 his father
removed to Kentucky, and in 1852 to New
Albany. Willson spent about a year at Antioch
College, in Ohio, and went afterward to
Harvard, but left in his sophomore year,
owing to ill health. His home was in Indiana<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
from 1852 to 1864. He wrote his best
poems, indeed the greater part of his slender
product, at New Albany, and his residence
there, in immediate contact with the seat of
war, colored his distinctive work. He married,
in 1863, Elizabeth Conwell Smith, whom he
had met the preceding year at New Albany,
and whose literary gifts created a bond of
sympathy between them. They removed
shortly to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where
one of Willson&#8217;s brothers was in school. He
purchased a house on the Mount Auburn
road, near Lowell&#8217;s home, with an outlook
on the Charles River. James R. Gilmore
(Edmund Kirke) was his neighbor and saw
much of him at Cambridge. He wrote, in
1895, his recollections, testifying to Willson&#8217;s
unusual qualities, and giving this description
of his personal appearance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Take him, all in all, he was the most lovable man I
ever knew; and as a mere specimen of physical manhood
he was a joy to look at. A little above the medium height,
he was perfectly proportioned and of a sinewy, symmetrical
figure. His hair was raven black, wavy, and glossy as satin.
His skin was alight olive, slightly tinged with red, and his
features were regular, somewhat prominent, and exceedingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
flexible, showing an organization of a highly sensitive
character. But his eyes were what riveted the observer&#8217;s
attention. Mr. Longfellow told me they were the finest
type of the Oriental, but I never saw eyes&mdash;Eastern or
Western&mdash;to compare with them in luminous power.
They were full, large, and dark, with overhanging lashes;
but for the life of me I cannot tell their precise color. At
times they seemed a deep blue, at other times an intense
black, and then they were balls of fire, as he was stirred by
some strong emotion. They spoke the ready language of
a deep, strong, fiery, yet chastened, nature as it was moved
by love, joy, sorrow or indignation.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Piatt remarks upon his &#8220;Oriental look and
manner,&#8221; and all who knew him were impressed
by his distinguished appearance and grave courtesy.
In 1858 New Albany became interested
in spiritualism. Willson fell under the spell and
began a study of the subject. Piatt says that
Willson &#8220;soon abandoned the professors, but
retained until his death a serious spiritual theory
or faith of his own. He believed&mdash;and he was
absolutely honest and sincere, I am sure, in his
faith&mdash;that the spirits of the dead could, and at
times do, have communication with the living.&#8221;</p>

<p>Willson seems not to have had an active occupation
at any time. His father had been successful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
in business, and dying at New Albany in
1859, left a comfortable fortune to his children.
The poet lived by himself for a number of years,
at New Albany, in a small house where he surrounded
himself with books and led the life of
a student. Louisville is directly across the Ohio
from New Albany, and Willson was known to a
few of the literary people on the Kentucky side,
particularly to Prentice. The approach of the
Civil War aroused in him a deep interest in its
great issues, and he wrote editorials in support
of the Union cause for Prentice&#8217;s <i>Journal</i>. He
began in the first year of the war, and concluded
later, his poem &#8220;In State,&#8221; which, in spite of its
occasional vagueness and its despairing view of
the political situation, is written in an effective
stanza and is splendidly imaginative. He gloomily
assumed that the nation was dead&mdash;hence
his personification of it as a prone figure lying
&#8220;in state,&#8221; and he brings the rulers of Europe
to look upon it,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent1">&#8220;The winds have tied the drifted snow</div>
<div class="indent">Around the face and chin; and lo,</div>
<div class="indent">The sceptred giants come and go</div>
<div class="verse">And shake their shadowy crowns and say: &#8216;We always feared it would be so!&#8217;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>There is hardly a stanza in the poem that does
not contain some striking image. It moves on
in the mournful cadence of a <i>miserere</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent1">&#8220;The Sisterhood that was so sweet,</div>
<div class="indent">The Starry System sphered complete,</div>
<div class="indent">Which the mazed Orient used to greet,</div>
<div class="verse">The Four and Thirty fallen Stars glimmer and glitter at her feet.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>He published, January 1, 1863, as a carrier&#8217;s
address in the Louisville <i>Journal</i>, &#8220;The Old
Sergeant,&#8221; which Piatt believed to have been
&#8220;the transcript of a real history, none of the
names in it being fictitious, and the story being
reported as exactly as possible from the lips of a
Federal assistant surgeon named Austin, with
whom Willson was acquainted at New Albany.&#8221;
The poem appeared anonymously, and for some
reason, which was never explained, Willson
seemed reluctant at first to admit its authorship.
It attracted wide attention. Gilmore relates
that early in 1863, in the office of the <i>Atlantic
Monthly</i>, he met Dr. Holmes, who held in his
hand a copy of the Louisville <i>Journal</i>, containing
&#8220;The Old Sergeant.&#8221; &#8220;Read that,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;and tell me if it&#8217;s not the finest thing since the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
war began. Sit down and read it here; you
might lose it if I let you take it away.&#8221; The
ballad is found in &#8220;The Old Sergeant and Other
Poems&#8221; (1867). It is a vivid narrative of sustained
power and interest, deriving strength from
the earnestness of the recital and the simple
language, sometimes descending to army slang,
of the soldier. The poem is historically accurate
and is a fine celebration of the battle of Shiloh:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">&#8220;There was where Lew Wallace showed them he was of the canny kin,</div>
<div class="verse">There was where old Nelson thundered, and where Rousseau waded in;</div>
<div class="verse">There McCook sent &#8217;em to breakfast, and we all began to win&mdash;</div>
<div class="indent">There was where the grapeshot took me, just as we began to win.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">&#8220;Now, a shroud of snow and silence over everything was spread;</div>
<div class="verse">And but for this old blue mantle and the old hat on my head,</div>
<div class="verse">I should not have even doubted, to this moment, I was dead&mdash;</div>
<div class="indent">For my footsteps were as silent as the snow upon the dead!&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There is a suggestion of Poe, whom Willson
greatly admired, in the repetition, with slight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
variation, of the third line of the stanza; but
such points Willson always considered carefully.
He was certainly not servilely imitative,
and he is an ungenerous critic who would
pick flaws in a poem that is so fine as a whole.
&#8220;The Old Sergeant&#8221; is entitled to a place with
the best poems of the war&mdash;with Mrs. Howe&#8217;s
&#8220;Battle Hymn,&#8221; Brownell&#8217;s stirring pieces, Will
H. Thompson&#8217;s &#8220;High Tide at Gettysburg,&#8221; and
Ticknor&#8217;s &#8220;Little Giffen.&#8221; These stand apart
from Lowell&#8217;s &#8220;Commemoration Ode&#8221; and similar
poems, which are civic rather than military.
In &#8220;The Rhyme of the Master&#8217;s Mate,&#8221; Willson
turned again to the heroic, and while the poem
is less artistic than &#8220;The Old Sergeant,&#8221; it has
a swing and a stroke that fit his theme well.
His volume contains a number of mystical
pieces, colored by his belief in spiritualism,
and a few lyrics, as &#8220;The Estray&#8221; and
&#8220;Autumn Song,&#8221; which have an elusive charm
and increase admiration for his talents. Willson
was emphatically a masculine character.
In literature and in life he liked what he
called &#8220;muscle,&#8221; and he certainly showed a
sinewy grasp in his best poems. It is related<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
that once during the war he organized, and
armed at his own expense, a home guard to
protect New Albany in a dangerous crisis, and
at other times he displayed great personal
courage. If it had not been for his ill health
he would undoubtedly have enlisted.</p>

<p>Willson was not immediately identified at
Cambridge as the author of &#8220;The Old Sergeant.&#8221;
As Dr. Holmes said after Willson&#8217;s
death, &#8220;He came among us as softly and
silently as a bird drops into his nest,&#8221; and it
was not like him to call attention to his own
performances. After the death of his wife
and infant child, October 13, 1864, Willson
was often at Gilmore&#8217;s house, where he first
saw Emerson. Gilmore relates that he returned
home one day from Boston to find
Lowell lying at full length on a lounge in the
library, in animated conversation with Willson.
On this occasion an incident occurred illustrative
of Willson&#8217;s gift of &#8220;second sight.&#8221; Longfellow
was mentioned in the conversation, and
Willson remarked that the poet would be there
shortly. No one had an intimation of the visit,
but Willson described the route that Longfellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
was then following toward the house; and
when the poet presently arrived, he affirmed
the statement of his itinerary as Willson had
given it. Willson&#8217;s interest in life ended with
the death of his wife, whose few poems he published
privately. She is remembered at New
Albany as a girl of great beauty and refinement.</p>

<p>Willson left Cambridge in the fall of 1866
for New Albany. While there he suffered
hemorrhages of the lungs and was ill for a
month. He never regained his strength, and
his death occurred February 2, 1867, at Alfred,
New York. His convictions as to spiritualism
grew firmer after his wife&#8217;s death, and toward
the last, so one of his brothers wrote, &#8220;his wife
and child seemed to be with him constantly,
and he talked to them in a low voice.&#8221; He
was buried at Laurel, the home of Mrs. Willson&#8217;s
family, in the White Water Valley. His
wife and child lie in one grave beside him.
The quiet hilltop cemetery commands a view
of one of the loveliest landscapes in Indiana,
and it is fitly touched with something of the
peace, strength, and beauty that are associated
with Willson&#8217;s name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span></p>


<h3>III. <i>Later Poets</i></h3>

<p>Willson marked the beginning of better
things, and a livelier fancy and a keener critical
spirit is henceforward observable&mdash;in the
writings of a veteran like Parker, and in the
new company of writers that was forming. The
Civil War had profoundly moved the Central
States, and Indiana had perhaps felt it more than
her neighbors. Willson had lifted his voice for
the Union while the war cloud still lay upon the
land, and the Thompson brothers spoke for
the South from Indiana soil on the arrival of
the era of better feeling. Ben D. House, who
had served in the Federal armies, wrote with
truth and spirit. He ran away from his home
in Vermont when he was seventeen, and entered
the army from Massachusetts. He saw
hard service, and received wounds which were
a constant menace for the remainder of his life.
He was mustered out finally at Indianapolis,
and lived there almost continuously until his
death in 1887. His idiosyncrasies and affectations
were many, and included the wearing of
a great cloak, in which he sombrely wrapped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
himself in cold weather. His poems were
printed privately by his friends in 1892. He
had fair luck with the sonnet, and wrote, on
the occasion of Grant&#8217;s death, &#8220;Appomattox,&#8221;
which follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;To peace-white ashes sunk war&#8217;s lurid flame;</div>
<div class="indent">The drums had ceased to growl, and died away</div>
<div class="indent">The bark of guns, where fronting armies lay,</div>
<div class="verse">And for the day the dogs of war were tame,</div>
<div class="verse">And resting on the field of blood-fought fame,</div>
<div class="indent">For peace at last o&#8217;er horrid war held sway</div>
<div class="indent">On her won field, a score of years to-day,</div>
<div class="verse">Where to her champion forth a white flag came.</div>
<div class="verse">O nation&#8217;s chief, thine eyes have seen again</div>
<div class="indent">A whiter flag come forth to summon thee</div>
<div class="verse">Than that pale scarf which gleamed above war&#8217;s stain,</div>
<div class="verse">To parley o&#8217;er the end of its red reign&mdash;</div>
<div class="indent">The truce of God that sets from battle free</div>
<div class="verse">Thy dauntless soul, and thy worn life from pain.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Lee O. Harris, a native of Pennsylvania
(1839), removed to the State in 1852, and was
an Indiana soldier in the Civil War. His verse,
as collected in &#8220;Interludes&#8221; (1893), shows little
of the military feeling, but is strongly domestic,
a forerunner of the work of Mr. Riley, whose
teacher Mr. Harris had been at Greenfield.</p>

<p>Dan L. Paine, an Indianapolis journalist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
(1830-1895), possessed a sound taste, and his
occasional pieces were well executed. He
wrote an elegy on the death of his friend and
fellow-journalist, George C. Harding, which is
a meditation on the courage of such spirits:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;On Freedom&#8217;s heights they stand as sentinels,</div>
<div class="indent">Brave tropic suns, delve in earth&#8217;s deepest caves,</div>
<div class="verse">And climb the ladder of the parallels</div>
<div class="indent">To sleep in icy graves.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Such felicities were not uncommon with him.
He was the friend and helpful critic of all the
younger Indiana writers, and literary reputations
have been created from slighter talents
than his. His poems were collected privately,
under the title &#8220;Club Moss&#8221; (1890).</p>

<p>So far nearly every name identified with the
literary impulse in Indiana has been met south
of a line drawn across the State at Crawfordsville;
but Evaleen Stein carried it farther north,
to Lafayette. Miss Stein&#8217;s verse illustrates
happily the growing emancipation of the
younger generation of Western poets from
bare didacticism, and an escape from the
landscape of tradition. She finds her subjects
in nature, and draws pictures for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
pleasure of it, and not with the expectation
of tacking a moral to the frame. Earnestness
and conviction characterize her verses, and
there is often a kind of exultance in the note
when she sings of the rough hill pastures or the
marshes and bayous that invite her study. She
has something of Thoreau&#8217;s genius for details,
and her volume &#8220;One Way to the Woods&#8221;
(1897) is an accurate calendar of the moods of
nature. Her work marks really a new generation,
the change of fashion, and the passing of
the ante-bellum poets of the region. Twenty
years earlier no Ohio Valley poet would have
explored a bayou, or could have written of it
so musically as Miss Stein:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Ah, surely none would ever guess</div>
<div class="verse">That through that tangled wilderness,</div>
<div class="indent">Through those far forest depths remote,</div>
<div class="verse">Lay any smallest path, much less</div>
<div class="indent">A way wherein to guide a boat!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>A small volume of the poems of M. Genevieve
Todd (1863-1896), of the order of Sisters
of Providence, was published after her
death. They are wholly devotional, and are
marked by elevation of spirit wedded to correct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
taste. Sister Mary Genevieve was born
at Vevay, of Protestant parents, and died at
the convent of St. Mary&#8217;s of the Woods near
Terre Haute. Albion Fellows Bacon, Mrs.
D. M. Jordan, Richard Lew Dawson, and William
R. Williams have also been creditable
contributors to the Hoosier anthology.</p>

<p>Indiana offers, on the whole, a fair field for
poets. The prevailing note of the landscape
is tranquillity. There is hardly a spot in the
State that touches the imagination with a
sense of power or grandeur, and yet there
are countless scenes of quiet beauty. The
Wabash gathers breadth and grace as it flows
southward. Long curves here and there give
to the eye the illusion of a chain of lakes, and
the river&#8217;s valley is a rich garden. The Tippecanoe
is another beautiful river, famous
among fishermen, and there are a number
of charming lakes in the northern part of
the State. The Kankakee marsh was long
haunted by the migrant wild birds, and in
recent years a wild goose was found there
with the piece of an Eskimo arrow, made of
reindeer bone, through its breast. Poets and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
novelists have found inspiration in the Kankakee.
Maurice Thompson and Evaleen Stein
have celebrated the region in song; and there
is a tradition that the manuscript of &#8220;Ben
Hur&#8221; visited both the Kankakee and Lake
Maxinkuckee at certain crises in its preparation.
The possibilities of mixed forests are
nowhere more happily illustrated than in
Indiana, whether in the earliest wistful days
of spring or in the full glory of autumn.
The beech and the elm, the maple, the
hickory and the walnut, and the humbler
sassafras and pawpaw are companions of a
royal order of forestry, from which the sycamore&mdash;the
self-constituted guardian of rivers
and creeks&mdash;is excluded by nature&#8217;s decree
confirmed by man&#8217;s preference. The variety
of cereals that may be grown saves the tilled
areas from monotony. There are no vast
plains of corn or wheat as in Kansas or the
Dakotas, but the corn ripens between wheat
stubble on one hand, and green pastures or
remnants of woodland on the other. The
transitional seasons bring more of delight to
the senses than the full measure of winter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
and summer, and have for the observer constant
novelty and change. There are qualities
in the spring of the Ohio Valley&mdash;qualities
of sweetness and wistfulness that
are peculiar to the region; and when the
winds are all from the south, and the winter
wheat is brilliant in the fields; when the
sap sings beneath the rough bark of the old
forest trees, and the young orchards are a blur
of pink and white, spirits are abroad there
with messages for the sons of men.</p>

<p class="ph3">Old Cambridge</p>

<p class="center">BY</p>

<p class="center"><b>THOMAS WENTWORTH HIGGINSON</b></p>

<p class="center"><b>Cloth. 12mo. Price $1.25</b></p>


<p>&#8220;... Some charmingly reminiscent pages, having for their subject
the three authors most widely associated with Old Cambridge,&mdash;Holmes,
Longfellow, and Lowell; and their pleasant gossip makes
up the major part of the volume, which is altogether a most enjoyable
and valuable one.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Evening Telegraph.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;It is just the sort of book that one would expect from the author,
graceful in form, abounding in the genuine atmosphere of the old
university town, full of pleasant personal anecdotes and reminiscences
of the Cambridge of forty or fifty years ago. Many great
figures pass across the stage, with nearly all of whom Colonel Higginson
was personally acquainted; and this intimacy gives the book
a charming flavor.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Brooklyn Life.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;The book contains material to be had nowhere else, for it is a
commentary on the side history of a great epoch in American letters,
written by one who had a place in it.&#8221;&mdash;<i>San Francisco Argonaut.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;What he has to tell will be interesting to every person who honors
New England and sets store by her literature. The book is steeped
in the Attic dew of which the Cambridge cicadas were fond; it has
a smack of ambrosia,&mdash;American ambrosia,&mdash;and its leaves rustle
with the unmistakable Parnassian suggestion&mdash;a Puritan Parnassus
to be sure.... The Cambridge he dwells upon is the Cambridge
of the Boston circle of poets, philosophers, politicians, reformers,
scholars, statesmen, preachers, and divine cranks. He sketches
everything and everybody freely, swiftly, and lightly.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Independent.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Transcendental Club&mdash;Brook Farm&mdash;The
School and Its Scholars&mdash;The Members&mdash;The
Visitors&mdash;The Closing Period&mdash;Bibliography&mdash;Index</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Swift ... deals with the experimenters rather
than with the experiments ... and with the influence of
the life at Brook Farm upon the individuality of its members.&#8221;&mdash;<i>The
Mail and Express.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Lindsay Swift takes up and describes very amply
the most romantic, interesting, and far-reaching movement
in the history of American literature&mdash;the story of Brook
Farm.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Times Saturday Review.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;The book has a value apart from its delineation of
Brook Farm.... It ought to be widely and carefully
read, especially where ... socialistic notions are gaining
many adherents, for it will aid the young enthusiast to define
what may be and what cannot be for a very long
century at least.&#8221;&mdash;<i>The Outlook.</i></p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
